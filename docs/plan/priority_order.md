# Priority order: every known gap, by importance and by dependency

Written 2026-09-29, docs only (nothing built or run). Inputs: every open row of `gaps.md` (struck rows skipped; merged
IDs resolve to their homes, gaps.md "Merged IDs"), `class_census.md` and `work/census/*.tsv` (the re-run of 2026-09-28),
the coordinator's memory notes (read-only) and the plan docs named per edge. Items that exist only in memory get an
`M-` name. `gaps.md` stays the backlog; this page only orders it.

## 1. Method

**Edges.** Four kinds, from the item to its prerequisite:

| kind | meaning |
|---|---|
| **depends** | cannot start without the prerequisite |
| **based-on** | builds on its data or structures |
| **reuses** | calls its code |
| **easier** | much cheaper once the prerequisite is done |

Evidence codes:

| code | source |
|---|---|
| `gaps` | the row's own "Depends on" / "Needs" column in gaps.md |
| `cen` | class_census.md's main table or its unique-blocker table |
| `u_s` | co-requirement counts computed for this page from `work/census/unit_systems.tsv` (units needing system X that also need Y; "sole" = X is the only non-conditional system the unit still lacks; conditional = cheat, Suck Cannon interface, save) |
| `LG` | level_generalisation.md |
| `LS` | level_scripting.md |
| `mem:<file>` | a memory note |

Inferred edges are marked **[L]**.

**Importance score** (0–11) = V + R + D + F. Effort (S / M / L) is kept apart and only breaks ties (S first).

| part | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **V** player-visible | not seen | minor, side by side only | seen in places | core play or progression on many levels |
| **R** reach (census created instances, else levels) | < 10 inst or 1 level | 10–99 or 2–4 levels | 100–499 or 5–9 levels | ≥ 500 or ≥ 10 levels |
| **D** dependents in this graph | none | 1–2 | 3–4 | ≥ 5 |
| **F** fidelity risk | none | known deviation | wrong behaviour on several levels | — |

**Order.**
- The order is topological: a wave holds only items whose prerequisites are all in earlier waves.
- Within a wave, items are ranked by score.
- A wave has at most **3 lanes**, one per concurrent agent. The lanes don't share files; file areas are marked [L]
  where they are inferred.
- A lane is a queue: its items run one after another.
- Quick wins go into the lane of the item they unblock.
- Deferred items are not scheduled (§5).

**Census caveat.**
- The census numbers below are the 2026-09-28 re-run (4,030 created instances in 417 units; cheap 197 / 1,308)
  unless a row says "2026-09-29".
- **W0 re-ran it on 2026-09-29** (class_census.md "Re-run 2026-09-29"): the family is unchanged (4,030 / 417), the
  stale tags are fixed (help, the splash and burn sparks, the Suck Cannon interface, the move-collide, the walk-to
  states, the ammo read, `PromptRelease`), and the census now sees direct reads of engine state (branches on the hero
  state / body, the ship moby, the cheat flag) plus two overrides (the fighters, the 838 / 855 emitters). Verdicts:
  cheap **208 / 1,177**, missing 163 / 2,594, partly 40 / 251, unknown 6 / 8; **ready now 243 units / 1,653**
  (cheap + conditional-only + a dead hero-state branch only). By system (units / instances): cheat 48 / 1,497
  (conditional), paths 31 / 1,108, hero states and bodies 68 / 880 (of which the branch tests: 14 / 169 on state
  0x32, 25 / 456 on the body), animation 42 / 422, creature copies 22 / 363, effect mobys 21 / 276, light flicker
  6 / 256, platforms 7 / 181, ship mode 2 / 112, particle types 14 / 90, break variant 5 / 87, camera 29 / 74, blob
  shadows 7 / 70, save bytes 3 / 45, level sound 4 / 41, save 38 / 39 (conditional), voice handoff 2 / 33, sprite
  helper 8 / 20. Sole blockers: paths 648 (17 units), hero states 297 (31), effect mobys 114 (12), creature 84 (5).
- What the re-run freed (`u_s` predicted about 40 units): the 21 help-only directors are cheap; of the 11 enemy
  units, 568 is cheap and the other ten are conditional on the cheat (and most also branch on the Giant Clank body:
  a dead branch to file); the 8 save-only directors are conditional. Not freed: the fighters (G-LVL-009) and
  838 / 855 (G-AUD-010), now overrides.

## 2. Dependency graph and scores

One row per item. Scores are V R D F = total; E = effort; W = wave (§4). "—" = no prerequisite in the sources.

## 4. The ordered plan

Each wave is ≤ 3 lanes; lanes are queues and don't share files. After W2, W3 and W4, re-run the census
(G-TOOL-017) before the next class wave.

| wave | lane (file area [L]) | items, in order | why here |
|---|---|---|---|
| **W0** housekeeping — **done 2026-09-29** except the user steps, G-TOOL-004 and G-TOOL-013 | A: git | ~~M-COMMIT~~ (3646133); then the user's G-TOOL-010 steps (open). Hold the `extracted/` regenerate until G-EXT-006, or accept losing the ELF reference. | Nothing else should build on 12 uncommitted files. |
| | B: `tools/trace`, `tools/ghidra/names`, class_census.md, gaps.md | ~~G-TOOL-017 re-run with the re-tag: G-TRI-015, help, `0x2ff768`, `0x271258`~~ (done, plus the data census and 30 named functions) → G-TOOL-013 (open: M effort, not started) | Every class wave's numbers and order depend on it; freed 21 help directors, 568 and the pushables 695; found the dead hero-state branches (§1). |
| | C: `docs/plan/*` except the two above | ~~DOC-STALE → G-TOOL-014~~ (done) → G-TOOL-004 (open) → the read-only triage checks ~~G-TRI-004 / 005 / 006 / 007 / 008 / 011~~ (closed, gaps.md) / 014 (open: 0x248920 not read) | Cheap, and it removes false leads before the ports. |

L03's nine-class family 246 moved to **G-CLS-028** (+ G-CLS-026): its private code is an explosion and an effect moby, not paths | 1,108 instances; sole blocker of 692 (after: `path` blocks 2) |

## 5. Deferred items (not scheduled)

⚑ marks a deferred item that blocks a lot of non-deferred work (worth reconsidering).

| item | would slot | depends on | blocks |
|---|---|---|---|
| ⚑ **G-SAV-002** save / load | Any time (no prerequisite); naturally with W4, whose story directors call `memcard_Save` (38 units / 39 instances, conditional; `cen`) | — | Depends: G-WPN-009 (gold weapons), G-SAV-003 / 004 / 005, **G-LVL-001**, G-UI-002's save pages (gaps). easier: G-TOOL-011 [L]. With G-SAV-001: G-CUT-003 → G-UI-004. |
| ⚑ **G-LVL-001** planet travel, space scenes, transition movies | After G-SAV-002 (gaps) and W4 (the level-exit classes, `OpenShipMenu`: 6 units, `cen`) | G-SAV-002 | Depends: **G-LVL-009** (242 instances: fighters 112 + the asteroid wake 130), G-CUT-004, G-UI-004, G-EXT-004, G-LVL-002's landing part (gaps). Every level except the start is reachable only by a debug boot (gaps top 15). |
| **G-SAV-001** main menu and title flow | With G-SAV-002 | — | Depends: G-CUT-003 (gaps) |
| **G-SAV-003** save-chunk writers | After G-SAV-002 | G-SAV-002 | the death / visit bytes of 44 / 78 (45 instances, `cen` "death") |
| **G-SAV-004** challenge mode | After G-SAV-002 | G-SAV-002 | the even gold-weapon offers, teleporter 961's gate |
| **G-SAV-005** nanotech upgrades | After G-SAV-002 | G-SAV-002 | — |
| **G-SAV-006** cheats | After W6 (G-UI-002) | G-UI-002 (gaps) | Nothing in normal play. 45 units / 1,454 instances call the manipulator only with the cheat on (`cen`), so port those classes now and file the branch. |
| **G-SAV-007** skill points | After W7 (G-CLS-015) | — | G-CLS-015's skill-point part (gaps); Kerwan 1342's cuboid |
| **G-SAV-009** statistics | After W4 (the directors write the records, LS §3) | — | nothing visible |
| **G-HERO-001** hero feel pass | After W2: G-LVL-002 H2 and G-HERO-002 leave `hero/**` settled [L] | M-PINE + the user's recording (gaps) | — |
| **G-TOOL-001** profiling session | After W7 (render and particle changes settled) [L] | the user plays | Depends: G-EXT-003 → G-MOD-005 (gaps). G-TOOL-002's fixes. |
| **G-TOOL-002** performance fixes | After G-TOOL-001 | user decisions (profile changes, the `hud_render.rs` edit) | — |
| **G-TOOL-016** native Phase 2, and **G-REN-017** (on hold) | Last, after the PCSX2 checks (decisions.md) | G-TOOL-003 / 005 / 007 | — |
| **G-MOD-001, G-MOD-002, G-MOD-003, G-MOD-004, G-MOD-005, G-MOD-006, G-MOD-007** mods | Last (mods.md: "last stage"). Chain 001 → 002 → 003 / 004, 001 → 006, G-EXT-003 → 005 (gaps). | the user's six answers (G-MOD-001) | — |
| **G-EXT-003** Tier 1 v2+; **G-EXT-004** the unknown lumps | After G-TOOL-001; after G-LVL-001 (gaps) | the deferred items | G-MOD-005 |
| **G-LCH-001** Official feed; **G-LCH-004** signing; **G-LCH-005** other discs; **G-EXT-001** strip / LTO / deployment target | User-gated: repo public, Apple ID, "deferred, not dropped", a decision | the user | — |
| **M-GSPOST** rename `rc-engine/src/gs_post.rs` (the user: "rename later"; mem:project-next-queue 2026-09-28) | Any time, S | — | — |
| **M-REORG** dev tooling reorg | **Already done** (d41ec5e, mem:project-dev-tooling-reorg); its follow-ups are G-TOOL-008 (W1 / W8), G-TOOL-009 and G-EXT-006 (W8) | — | — |

**Blocked by deferred items** (not deferred themselves): G-WPN-009, G-CUT-003, G-CUT-004, G-UI-004, G-LVL-009,
G-EXT-003, G-EXT-004, and the census's level-exit (6) and save (39, conditional) calls.

**Reconsider:**
- **G-SAV-002** blocks 6 rows directly and 5 more through G-LVL-001.
- **G-LVL-001** holds all story flow between levels and ship combat.

Both lead the gaps.md top 15.

## 6. Top 20, in the order to do them

1. **M-COMMIT**: 12 uncommitted files in `creature/` and `classes/`, which the next three lanes edit.
2. ~~**G-TOOL-017 + G-TRI-015**~~: done 2026-09-29 (class_census.md "Re-run 2026-09-29").
3. ~~**G-CLS-025** path helpers: the largest real blocker (1,108 instances; sole 692)~~ done 2026-09-29 (W1 lane 1; census: `path` blocks 2). Next in its place: **G-CLS-028** (L03's air traffic 246: its own explosion + G-CLS-026's moby 235).
4. ~~**G-ENM-009** creature copies: 363 instances (2026-09-29; sole blocker of 84)~~ done 2026-09-29 (W1 lane 2): 146 instances ported, 44 freed (340, 333, 217, 578; cheat-conditional).
5. ~~**G-LVL-002 H2** (with X1): the hero code may differ on 10 levels; prerequisite of G-HERO-002.~~ Done 2026-09-29 (W1 lane 3). Follow-up: **G-HERO-031** superset audit (S–M, the list is generated).
6. **G-ENM-010 / G-ENM-001**: 11 enemy units / 407 instances are ready now (568 cheap, ten conditional on the cheat with a
   dead Giant Clank branch); enemies ignore weapons on 18 levels.
7. **G-CLS-001·L part 1 + G-SAV-010**: 29 directors are ready once help counts as ported; the story and hints of
   every level.
8. ~~**G-HERO-002** scripted states~~: done 2026-09-29 (0x1f / 0x32 / 0x78; 1039 and 438 ported; the unblocked units go to G-CLS-027).
9. **G-HERO-027 + G-HERO-026** camera: every level's camera volumes; co-needed by the directors.
10. **G-HERO-009** joint modifiers: 422 instances; reused by Clank's pulse, the Visibomb fins and the vendor logo.
11. **G-REN-024 + G-CLS-024**: 256 + 181 instances; together they free 1246 (126).
12. **G-CLS-026** effect-moby spawners: 276 instances (sole blocker of 114).
13. **G-HERO-005** Clank and Giant Clank: sections on 8 + 8 levels.
14. **G-CLS-027** cheap wins round 2: 1,177 instances of class-only work, 1,653 with the conditional and dead-branch units.
15. **G-CLS-001·L part 2**: the directors that need the camera and hero states.
16. **G-CLS-018 + G-CLS-023 (+ G-CLS-010)**: dormant pools, spawners, teleporters on 8 levels.
17. **G-UI-011** HUD slots: prerequisite of the gadgets and the races.
18. **G-WPN-006** utility gadgets: they gate progression; prerequisite of the puzzles.
19. **G-HERO-029 → G-HERO-008** Hoverboard: prerequisite of the races.
20. **G-CLS-003** Trespasser and Hydrodisplacer puzzles: the progression gates on 7 + 5 levels.

## 7. Needs triage, and contradictions found

**Too unclear to place:**

| item | source | where it would go if confirmed |
|---|---|---|
| G-TRI-001 `slab_allocator` use-after-free log lines | gaps | its own bug hunt; before W7's render lane |
| ~~G-TRI-004 script-camera push; G-TRI-005 `unknown_74`; G-TRI-006 shadow probe; G-TRI-007 `ripple_z`; G-TRI-008 ISO lumps; G-TRI-011 fog-zone camera~~ | checked 2026-09-29: closed in gaps.md (each with its finding) | — |
| G-TRI-009 Oltanis instances without geometry; G-TRI-010 mpegs 0, 1, 64–69; G-TRI-012 texture `type` enum; G-TRI-013 unknowns lists | gaps | no consumer yet (no-speculative-ports rule) |
| G-TRI-014 pad vibration | gaps | still open: the boot ELF links libpad's vibration (`sce_vib_*` at 0x1250d8…); `0x248920` not read |
| ~~G-TRI-016 the L15 / L18 missile from level hero code~~ | resolved 2026-09-29: Giant Clank's states 0x5d / 0x5f → a consumer of G-HERO-005 (W4) | — |
| G-PRT-004 ribbon / line callers | gaps ("names none") | no consumer named: hold |
| M-SPHERES `class_spheres` from the class header at load | mem:project-next-queue 2026-09-26 (creatures leftover); the tests fill them by hand (`all_levels_smoke.rs:191`) | the moby system (W4 lane 3) if the engine doesn't |
| M-APPICON the launcher's app icon ("amateurish" first attempt) | mem:project-launcher-and-mods | W8 lane 3, if still open (the launcher has `assets-src/icon/gen.py`) |
| M-WATER-EXACT whether to chase byte-exact water after the perf rewrite | mem:project-randcre-status-2026-09-26 | a user decision; G-TOOL-016 territory |
| ~~M-249530 `0x249530` "Drone Device path" (census, Kerwan 1342) vs G-WPN-002's Gadgets-page path `0x28f260`~~ | resolved 2026-09-29: `0x249530` is the ammo read (`hero/weapons.rs`, ported); the census note was wrong; 1342 is cheap | — |

**Contradictions (all resolved 2026-09-29 unless marked):**
- **Circular "Depends on" pairs in gaps.md:**
  - G-HERO-005 ↔ G-WPN-006, over the Hologuise only. Resolved: the body switch is hero code and depends on nothing in
    the gadget; the Hologuise body 3 has no consumer without the gadget, so it is ported with G-WPN-006 (W5), which
    depends on G-HERO-005's body switch. Bodies 1 / 2 stay in W4.
  - G-UI-011 ↔ G-LVL-007, over the race timer only. Resolved: the slot machinery is ported; the race timer's only
    consumer is the races, so it is ported with G-LVL-007 (W6); G-UI-011 no longer depends on G-LVL-007.
- **Stale census tags.** Fixed: help, the splash and burn sparks and the Suck Cannon interface are tagged has against
  the code (class_census.md "Re-run 2026-09-29").
- **Cheap list vs gaps.** Fixed: the census now reads engine state directly (the hero state / body compares, the ship
  moby, the cheat flag) and carries overrides for what it still cannot see (the fighters, 838 / 855).
- **Mixed counts in gaps.md.** Fixed: the rows and the top 15 both use the 2026-09-29 run.
- **The dev tooling reorg.** MEMORY.md indexes it as "deferred", but its note says done (d41ec5e, 2026-09-27): for
  the coordinator's memory index (not a repo file).
- **Digest baseline.** Re-derived: NO_IDLE `596306d7baa53abb8107b2d0ccfc5369`, full `42ec9908f7c83181a599154cb4749b40`
  (gaps.md G-TOOL-014); the commit that moved it off `94746b95` is not bisected (hero_gameplay.md §12 already
  reports `596306d7`).
- **Locked Goodies pages.** They are pause pages: G-UI-002; menus.md §12 fixed.
- **The `.mov` files.** G-TOOL-010 is count-agnostic now.
- **The in-game map.** Removed from gaps.md's [deferred] marker list.
- **The pack swap** (M-PACK): not a gap; no doc implied it was missing (checked 2026-09-29).
