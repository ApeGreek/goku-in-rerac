# Class census: the unported moby classes and the shared systems they need

A static census (2026-09-28) of every moby class placed on levels 00–18 whose level update the port does not run
(gaps.md G-CLS-001). For each class it finds the update function on every level, groups the level copies that are the
same code into one **class-port unit** (the way `LevelPorts` matches ports), walks the unit's static call graph down to
the **shared functions** it calls (engine code in the overlay, level code other classes also call, the boot ELF), and
tags each shared function with the game system it belongs to and whether the port has it.

Nothing in `crates/` changed. The tool is a new `rc-trace` subcommand; the tags are a committed table.

**Numbers at this run.** 668 unported class-levels: **6,029 placed, 5,533 created** instances (G-CLS-001 said 5,543:
the sea port landed during the run and took 10), in **448 class-port units**. They call **473 shared functions**;
430 are tagged, 43 (all of them rare) are not. Every unit's call graph was walked (100 % of classes and instances); a
system verdict exists for **429 units / 5,485 created instances (99.1 %)**; 19 units / 48 instances call an untagged
function and nothing else the port lacks.

**Re-run 2026-09-28 (after the cheap-wins batches and the other ports of that day):** 548 unported class-levels,
4,526 placed / **4,030 created** instances in 417 units; verdicts cheap 197 units / 1,308, missing 161 / 2,470, partly
40 / 204, unknown 19 / 48. The unit ids change between runs (they are numbered by instances).

**Re-run 2026-09-29 (W0, priority_order.md: the re-tag and the data census).** The unported family is unchanged
(548 class-levels, 4,526 placed / **4,030 created** instances, 417 units: no class port landed between the runs), but
the census now also sees **direct reads of engine state** (§Method 7: a `G:` tag per global, `X:` overrides), and the
tags were verified against the code: the Suck Cannon interface (G-TRI-015), the help system, the splash `0x2ff768`, the
burn sparks `0x271258`, the move-collide `0x26d270`, the Doom bot's hop `0x270340`, the feather spawner `0x2e2cc0`, the
ammo read `0x249530`, the walk-to-point states `0x249580` / `0x2495d0` and `0x279070` (Lombyte's "OpenShipMenu": it is
`PromptRelease`, interact.rs) are **has**. New: the fighters 1843 / 1319 (ship-combat mode, G-LVL-009) and the emitters
838 / 855 (voice handoff, G-AUD-010) are blocked by overrides; branches on hero states 0x32 / 0x51 and on the bodies
0x1413f4 = 1 / 2 / 3 (G-HERO-002 / G-HERO-005), the cheat flag `0x15edb7`, `SwitchCharacter` and the leave-body copies
are tagged; 30 of the 43 untagged functions are named. **480 shared keys, 467 tagged, 13 untagged**; unresolved units
19 / 48 → **6 / 8**. Verdicts:

| verdict (per unit) | units | created instances | 2026-09-28 re-run |
|---|---|---|---|
| **cheap**: every shared call is one the port has (or trivial arithmetic, or the class family's own level code) | 208 | 1,177 | 197 / 1,308 |
| **missing**: calls at least one function of a system the port lacks | 163 | 2,594 | 161 / 2,470 |
| **partly**: calls a function the port has only in part, or **branches on a hero state / body the port lacks** | 40 | 251 | 40 / 204 |
| **unknown**: nothing missing, but one untagged function | 6 | 8 | 19 / 48 |

**Re-run 2026-09-29 (W1 lane 1, the path helpers: G-CLS-025).** The path helpers are ported (`rc-game/src/path.rs`;
seven census keys re-tagged has: `0x262e40` / `0x277d40`, `0x261d78`, `0x264558` / `0x2a0260`, `0x263710` / `0x261b48`)
and three of their units landed (below, "In the port: path units": 1564, 257, 1667–1671: 203 instances). **538**
unported class-levels, 4,323 placed / **3,827 created** instances in **414 units**; verdicts cheap 219 units / 1,498,
missing 147 / 2,030, partly 42 / 291, unknown 6 / 8. The `path` system blocks **1 unit / 2 instances** (947 on level
10: `0x277260`, unported). A caution on the re-tag: the census counts a function as the unit's own when only that unit
calls it, so a unit can turn "cheap" while its private code holds a whole system. Level 03's air-traffic family
(75, 115–120, 132, 795: `0x29dba8`, 246 instances) is the case: its own code includes a level-03 explosion `0x24ce98`
(3,136 words: the beam-explosion family compiled into the overlay; G-CLS-028) and the effect-moby spawner `0x2bad40`
(class 235; G-CLS-026). It is not cheap.

"Cheap" means the class needs **only its own code** ported: the shared systems are there. It is not free: the
appendix gives each unit's private code size (functions / words).

Two systems are **conditional**: they run only when the player does something specific, so a class that needs only
them still works in normal play. The big-head **cheat** manipulator (the enemies' `0x278720` and its level copies) and
the cheat flag `0x15edb7` run only with the cheat on; **memcard_Save** only at a save point. (The Suck Cannon interface
was the third; the port has it since G-WPN-003 closed.) A **branch on a hero state or body** the port lacks (state
0x32, Clank's 0x51, the bodies 1 / 2 / 3) is a dead branch, not a blocker of the class: the port can take the class
with the branch filed under G-HERO-002 / G-HERO-005.

**Ready now** (blockers only conditional, or only such branches): **243 units / 1,653 created instances** — 208 / 1,177
cheap, 17 / 246 conditional-only, 18 / 230 with a hero-state branch (the same measure on the 2026-09-28 tags, counting
the Suck Cannon interface as conditional: 215 / 1,722; the difference is the fighters 112 and the emitters 33 leaving,
and the help / splash / burn / react units joining).

## Method (to regenerate)

```
cargo run -p rc-trace -- class-census          # writes work/census/*.tsv (about 15 s)
```

`tools/trace/src/class_census.rs` (the `class-census` command; `--out DIR`, `--tags FILE`, `--extracted DIR`). Inputs:
`extracted/levels/NN/{overlay.bin, gameplay_ntsc.bin}`, the port's registry `rc_game::moby_update::classes::LevelPorts`,
`tools/ghidra/names/clusters.tsv`, the decompiler export's `work/decomp/<program>/index.tsv` (names only) and the tag
table `tools/ghidra/names/census_systems.tsv`.

1. **Class list and instances.** Per level the class table (`LevelOverlay::vtbl`), and per class the placed instances
   (the gameplay instance list) and the created ones (`moby_spawn::loader_spawns` with an empty save, as
   `all_levels_smoke` counts them). A class is unported when `LevelPorts::get` gives no port and its update is not 0;
   the created total (5,533) equals `all_levels_smoke`'s report at the same moment.
2. **Call graph.** Function starts exactly as `LevelOverlay` finds them (`jal` targets, class-table updates, a frame
   set-up after `jr ra`, code addresses formed with `lui`/`%lo`). Edges: `jal`; a `j` out of the function (tail call);
   a code address formed with `lui`/`%lo` when the target also has start evidence of its own (a `jal` target, a
   class-table entry, or right after `jr ra` + delay slot) — callbacks such as draw callbacks and state functions
   stored into moby +0x74; a `.data` table of such starts formed the same way; and the fall-through into a start that
   has no evidence of its own. `jalr` sites are counted as unresolved indirect calls: **none** of the 448 units' own
   functions contains one (indirect calls live in engine code), so no call is left unresolved.
3. **Units.** From the update, a callee joins the unit when every caller of it is already in the unit; the callees
   left outside are the unit's shared functions. Level copies of an update are one unit when their masked code (the
   `Relocation` masking: `rc_formats::level_overlay::mask`) hashes the same.
4. **Identity of a shared function across levels**: its boot address (`boot:`); its level-01 copy by the port's
   `Relocation` (a function start in level 01, same extent for functions under 8 words); else its level-01 member in
   `clusters.tsv`; else the cluster (`C:` + 12 hex of the cluster hash: engine code that the level-01 overlay does not
   link); else the masked-code hash (`H:`).
5. **Has / partly / missing** was decided per function by searching `crates/` and `docs/` for the level-01 address
   (`shared.tsv` columns `crates_refs`, `crates_files`) and reading the cited code: a function the port cites as its
   model is "has", one it cites as counted / not ported is "missing", one without a citation was read in the decomp
   (`work/decomp/`, and Ghidra for spot checks of the graph, e.g. level03 `0x29dba8`'s callees) and tagged by what it
   does, marked `L` (inferred). Two extra statuses: `trivial` (arithmetic a port writes inline: zero a vector, fabs,
   memset) and `family` (level code shared only by the classes of one family, so part of their own port).
6. **Outputs** in `work/census/`: `classes.tsv` (level, class, placed, created, update, unit, port), `units.tsv`
   (instances, levels, classes, update copies, level-01 copy, private functions / words, `jalr`, shared keys),
   `shared.tsv` (per shared key: units, instances, the port's citations, callees), `globals.tsv` (every boot global an
   unported unit's own code forms, with the units), and with the tags `unit_systems.tsv` (verdict, systems, blocking
   keys, untagged) and `systems.tsv` (the ranking below).
7. **Direct reads of engine state** (2026-09-29). A call census misses a class that reads or writes engine state
   directly (the fighters test Ratchet's state and the ship moby; 838 rewrites a voice slot's owner). The tool now
   walks each unit's own code with a small register file: every `lui` (+ `addiu` / `ori`) constant, every load or
   store whose base register holds one (`base + offset`: the hero state `0x1413d4` read as `0x13f350 + 0x2084`), and
   every loaded global compared with a constant (`xori`, or `beq` / `bne` against a register holding one) becomes a
   data key: `G:<address>` or `G:<address>=<constant>` (`G:001413d4=00000032`: the hero state against 0x32). Only the
   keys the tag table names count as dependencies (a `G:` row has a system and status like a function); the rest are
   listed in `globals.tsv` for the next tagging pass. Stores through a computed index (838's `0x13e5d8 + slot·0x70`)
   are still invisible: those get an `X:<class>` **override** row with the reason (the fighters 1843 / 1319, the
   emitters 838 / 855).

**Limits.** The census sees **calls, and the tagged direct reads of §7**. A read through a computed index or a
pointer chain (a voice slot's owner by slot index, another moby's fields) shows no dependency; the saved-game flags
0x13d388 of G-SAV-010 are formed by 34 units but are not a blocker (`interact::set_global_flag` is ported). Tags marked
`L` were read from the decompiled code without a port to compare with. A function's status is about the function; a
system's status is "partly" when the port has any of its functions.

## Main table: missing or partial systems, ranked by the instances they block

A unit counts toward every system it needs; "classes" counts distinct class numbers. Addresses are level 01 unless
marked; `C:` rows cite one level copy (the others: `clusters.tsv`).

Sole blockers (the one system a unit still needs, cheats and saves aside; the W0 run — after W1 the path entry is 2 (1 unit)): path 648 (17 units), herostate 297 (31 units), fxmoby 114 (12 units), creature 84 (5 units), lsound 38 (1 units), ptype 38 (8 units), platform 36 (3 units), voicehand 33 (2 units), anim 23 (18 units), fxdraw 20 (8 units), camera 17 (8 units), light 14 (2 units), death 7 (1 units), shadow 4 (1 units), particles 2 (1 units), levelexit 2 (2 units), cine 1 (1 units).

**What the port already has** (and the unported classes lean on most): math, timers and RNG (VecAdd, `ticks`, the
`rand` stream: called by most units), moby create / delete / matrix, animation (`MobyAnimBlend`, joints, manipulators), class
sounds and voice slots, the Suck Cannon reaction interface, the help messages and prompts, hit messages and the hit resolver, the creature layer (knockback, hit flash, burn sparks, the water splash, turn, walker,
move-collide, target, arena paths, death explosion, `SpawnBeamExplosion`, `BreakFxB`), the ported particle types' spawners, collision queries,
trigger volumes, death bits and bolt drops, the shadow probe, draw callbacks with `FastDrawQuadReal` / FX textures /
the glow quad, the script camera and cinematic calls, the HUD banner, groups, splines and the flyer path driver, point
lights, the target list, mission flags.

## Cheap wins: classes whose shared calls the port already has

**208 units / 1,177 created instances** (2026-09-29 run) call only functions the port has (or trivial arithmetic, or
their family's own level code). Each needs its own update ported, nothing shared first. Unit ids are this run's (they
renumber per run; the "In the port" tables below keep the ids of their own runs). The largest 45 (the rest are in
the appendix, verdict "cheap"); "private" is the unit's own code in 32-bit words:

| unit | classes | levels | created | update (first copy) | private words |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

**Ready with a conditional blocker only** (the cheat manipulator / flag or `memcard_Save`; 17 units / 246): U268 (252: 77); U406 (63: 58); U299 (52: 46); U520 (1445: 24); ~~U334 (1199: 15); U405 (29: 9); U333 (1196: 7)~~ (ported 2026-09-29, W3); U163 (1120: 1); U164 (1190: 1); U311 (1290: 1); U318 (18: 1); U339 (1326: 1); U349 (23: 1); U459 (1354: 1); U485 (1388: 1); U488 (1419: 1); U570 (1750: 1).

**Ready with a hero-state branch only** (a dead branch on state 0x32 / 0x51 or on the body 0x1413f4, to file under
G-HERO-002 / G-HERO-005 in the class port; 18 units / 230): U300 (193: 93); ~~U335 (1202: 57)~~ (ported 2026-09-29, W3); U478 (233: 28); U387 (336: 11); U439 (250: 11); U330 (1067: 6); U336 (1229: 5); U338 (1302: 5); U471 (92: 4); U548 (1772: 2); U231 (1302: 1); U301 (263, 264, 265, 266, 267: 1); U331 (1073: 1); U356 (361: 1); U415 (388: 1); U425 (1271: 1); U493 (1469: 1); U544 (1428: 1).

Newly ready since the 2026-09-28 tags: the help directors and NPCs that needed only the help system (1413, 1324, 1343,
1347, 1348, 1349, 1000, 1344, 422, 558, 253, 1179, 586, 1035, 318 and more: every "partly: help" unit), Kerwan's
director 1342 (`0x249530` is the ammo read, ported), the enemies that needed only the Suck Cannon interface (568;
193, 252, 63, 1202, 52, 1445, 1199, 29, 1196 stay conditional on the cheat), the splash / burn callers 35 and 8, the
pushables 695 (`0x26d270`). No longer cheap: the fighters 1843 / 1319 (G-LVL-009) and the emitters 838 / 855
(G-AUD-010), by override; 4 units read the cheat flag directly (1440, 427, 44, 638: conditional).

Notes: U21 (class 1060, 334 lamps on 00 / 02 / 05 / 18, first run) and U92 (12 classes on 10 levels, 67 instances,
first run) are ported (below). Under G-CLS-027 these are one batch of class ports.

### In the port: cheap wins, levels 00–08 (2026-09-28, G-CLS-027 part A)

Unit ids below are the census's after the re-run of 2026-09-28 (the run renumbers them: U21 above is U27 here). Each
unit is one row of `rc_game::moby_update::classes::units::PORTS` (`ClassUpdate::Unit(i)`, shared with the 09–18 half),
found on every level by code identity; the module doc of each port carries the unit's coverage table (every call,
branch and side effect of the update and its private helpers, with the file / function or the gap).

| unit | classes (levels) | created | reference | port | notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| U27 | 1060 lamps (00, 02, 05, 18) | 334 | level00 0x2df4f8 | `units::lamp` | colour pulse, ambient (red, blue, 0: the game's argument slip, kept), one glow callback per group and tick through the pvar **shared data** (gameplay 0x4c, now loaded: `Services::pvar_shared`); `Callback::UnitGlow` drawn by `rc-engine` fx_draw with the shared glow quad `0x2781d0` |
| U99 | 12 classes on 10 levels | 67 | level02 0x2dd4d0 | `units::empty` | `jr ra; nop`: `LevelPorts` maps every table entry that starts with `jr ra; nop` (and has no other port) to it; also the unplaced 433 / 531 / 618 / 1289 … of every level (Novalis included: they were parked with mode 2, the game updates them) |
| U268 | 21 loose-piece classes (08) | 85 | level08 0x2dba40 | `units::loose_piece` | rest (state 2) until set loose by another moby: tumble about an anchor, bounce (`coll_sphere` + reflect ×0.5), fade, delete below z 5; the mover is outside the unit |
| U95 | 296, 652, 653 conveyors (02, 12) | 42 | level02 0x2dc6b0 | `units::conveyor` | carry riders by a heading velocity (`triggers::carry_riders`); one-way or reversing every 180 ticks |
| U241 | 886 timed switches (07, 12) | 30 | level07 0x30bf90 | `units::timed_switch` | group state machine (`scheduler::group_state` / `group_cmd`), countdown ticks, mission done |
| U247 | 9 mover classes (07, 13) | 28 | level07 0x310df0 | `units::linked_mover` | slides out / back on a linked moby's states; the in-game map zone flags `0x184528[i]` it writes are not ported (G-UI-001) |
| U229 | 1512 vents (06) | 26 | level06 0x308c68 | `units::vent` | steam puffs / spark bursts (type 2), the delayed death explosion |
| U280 | 621 rail mines (08) | 25 | level08 0x2f44c0 | `units::grind_mine` | a hit or a grinding Ratchet → `SpawnBeamExplosion`; the path mode's path pointer is taken as a spline index [L] |
| U185 | 852, 853 rising blocks (05) | 21 | level05 0x314eb0 | `units::rising_block` | `0x270830` spring (moved from the water managers to `creature::turn::spring`: two consumers) |
| U221 | 1091–1098, 1103 bobbing blocks (06) | 21 | level06 0x300df0 | `units::bob_block` | |
| U281 | 648 smoke emitters (08, 10) | 21 | level08 0x2f5830 | `units::smoke_emitter` | the default plume's third jitter lands on x again (kept) |
| U139 | 915–917 markers (03, 10) | 19 | level03 0x2dc310 | `units::marker` | deleted by their first update |
| U170 | 341 Hydrodisplacer pads (05, 07, 11, 12, 18) | 17 | level05 0x2f8080 | `units::hydro_pad` | |

**Not cheap after all** (found while porting): U180 (838, 05: 26) and U186 (855, 05: 7) hand one looping voice between
the group's emitters (the nearest to the camera rewrites the slot record's owner and position, `0x13e5d8 + slot·0x70`):
G-AUD-010. **Census artefacts**: U36 (class 27, 01: 10) is the particle emitter the engine runs as an external
(`LevelPorts::external`); the census counts only `LevelPorts::get`. Not reached (budget): U211, U168, U182, U248, U207,
U123, U208, U278, U215 and the smaller units of the appendix (G-CLS-027).

Tests: `rc-game/tests/classes/cheap_classes_a.rs` (every unit resolves on exactly its census levels with the census's counts;
unit addresses distinct; one headless behaviour test per unit on one of its levels); unit tests in each module.

### In the port: cheap wins, levels 09–18 (2026-09-28, G-CLS-027 part B)

Same registry and conventions as part A (unit ids of the re-run before it). The coverage tables are in
docs/plan/class_units_levels_09_18.md and the module docs; tests `rc-game/tests/classes/cheap_classes_b.rs`.

| unit | classes (levels) | created | reference | port | notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| U408 | 212, 1412 asteroids (13) | 130 | level13 0x2e1638 | `units::asteroid` | idle spin; drift / split / respawn ported, the wake needs the ship-combat mode (G-LVL-009) |
| U303 | 1181 chain links (09) | 124 | level09 0x304360 | `units::chain_link` | the break runs down the chain and tells the platform core |
| U553 | 885…936 grouped pieces (18) | 119 | level18 0x2e9768 | `units::barricade` | a hit sets the group flying (`scheduler::group_state`) |
| U294 | 1182–1189 tethered platforms (09) | 80 | level09 0x2c26c8 | `units::tethered_platform` | bob / wobble, pieces on the core's joint, the fall into the lava, global-flag writes (`interact::set_global_flag`) |
| U417 | 1261 explosive tanks (13) | 55 | level13 0x307b10 | `units::explosive_tank` | + its fireball class 1634 (0x30c3b8) |
| U533 | 1359…1373 sliding doors (17) | 52 | level17 0x2e87d8 | `units::fleet_door` | |
| U477 | 937 cogs (15) | 48 | level15 0x2e46b0 | `units::linked_cog` | |
| U563 | 1584 carriers (18) | 38 | level18 0x2fa728 | `units::veldin_carrier` | |
| U500 | 650 floats (16) | 29 | level16 0x2d5cb8 | `units::rising_float` | |
| U479 | 1250 belts (15) | 18 | level15 0x2e73c0 | `units::quartu_belt` | |
| U499 | 647 pieces (16) | 16 | level16 0x2d59e0 | `units::extending_piece` | |
| U559 | 1432 (18) | 13 | level18 0x2f7ab0 | `units::hidden_prop` | |
| U493 | 482 (16) | 8 | level16 0x2cb600 | `units::marker::update` | `DeleteMoby(self)` |
| U484 | 1425 bubble vents (15) | 6 | level15 0x2eb928 | `units::bubble_vent` | |
| U456 | 1397 (14) | 6 | level14 0x3061d8 | `units::oltanis_switchboard` | |

**Not cheap after all**: U543 (1843, 17: 60) and U370 (1319, 11: 52), one fighter source per level, need Ratchet's
ship-combat mode (hero state 0x32 with the ship moby 0x140940): G-LVL-009. Not attempted: U474 (408: its own draw
callback) and the rest of the part B appendix (117 units / 959 instances after the re-run).

**Re-run after both halves (2026-09-28):** 548 unported class-levels, 4,526 placed / **4,030 created** instances, 417
units; verdicts: cheap 197 units / 1,308, missing 161 / 2,470, partly 40 / 204, unknown 19 / 48.

### In the port: path units (2026-09-29, W1 lane 1, G-CLS-025)

The path helpers first (`rc-game/src/path.rs`: the system-or-not table of every copy is its module doc; `pose`
`0x262e40` / `0x277d40`, `push_from_walls` `0x261d78`, `nearest_at_distance` `0x264558` / `0x2a0260` = the flyer
driver's `0x28b510`, which now calls it; `0x263710` / `0x261b48` are `ClampToPath`, `World::clamp_to_path_hit`), then
the units the helpers alone blocked, in `units::PORTS`; coverage tables in the module docs, tests
`rc-game/tests/classes/path_classes.rs` (an owned-slot sound sink, so `SoundIsAlive` is the game's check).

| unit | classes (levels) | created | reference | port | notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| U36 | 1564 path gliders (00, 07, 10, 18) | 92 | level00 0x2e3a88 | `units::path_glider` | 6 units/s on the first segment, pitch halved, flap / glide blends on the animation wrap; the data words are the same on the four levels |
| U523 | 1667–1671 air traffic (16) | 90 | level16 0x2e76b8 | `units::kalebo_traffic` | one member's init places the group (shuffled, even t); spacing by target-speed swaps; unseen vehicles jump ahead; type-22 exhaust (odd classes), loop sound (even) |
| U495 | 257 rail cars (16) | 21 | level16 0x2c3d38 | `units::rail_car` | runs when Ratchet grinds (state group 0xf) in its cuboid; loop sound 0, sound 1 within 7; hidden at the end, reset out of view |

**Not path-blocked after all**: U127 (level 03's 75, 115–120, 132, 795: 246) is a flyer-driver variant (the level-01
driver's tangent / Hermite / arc-length helpers, `classes::flyer`) whose own code is a level-03 explosion `0x24ce98`
(3,136 words; G-CLS-028), the class-235 exhaust moby `0x2bad40` (G-CLS-026), `BreakFxB` wrecks per class, `BoltBurst`
`0x24f1b8`, a skill point / banner for 795, class sounds and type-22 sparks. U572 (1906, 18: 18) calls the path
helper from its own walk code but is a creature (hit handler `0x25e9d8`, death explosion `0x260790`, react
`0x25bd28`: G-ENM-009). U326 (947, 10: 2) needs `0x277260` (left in G-CLS-025). The other former path units (827,
749, 580, 1262, 238, 294, 857, 1213 / 1212 …) wait on the cheat, the light flicker, the creature copies, the hero
states or their own draw callbacks (unit_systems.tsv).

### In the port: creature units (2026-09-29, W1 lane 2, G-ENM-009)

System or not first (creatures.md §9.1): the census's three `creature` clusters were two already-ported functions
(`C:d001715051e4` = `0x274b78`, `C:ad33de15cdab` / `C:a8d6490c966c` = `0x26de80`; re-tagged has) and the random
wander `C:9a9b8f2fffcb` `0x261630` (six levels; the census had folded it into each consumer's private code), ported as
`creature::walker::wander`; the joint hit `C:76f90a069f65` / `0x26e830` got a real port (`attack::joint_hit`). Units,
in `units::PORTS`; coverage tables in creatures.md §9.3, tests `rc-game/tests/classes/creature_classes.rs`.

| unit | classes (levels) | created | reference | port | notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| U25 | 749 horny toads (00, 18) | 106 | level00 0x2d4610 | `units::horny_toad` | wander / chase / bite (joint hit, flags 1); dies from any hit; lure, Suck Cannon (`react::VELDIN_749`), presses floor switches |
| U287 | 1023 hopping gunners (08, 09), shot 1292 | 40 | level08 0x301158, 0x307298 | `units::hop_gunner` | carried gun 1025, hop arc, 20-shot bursts, club, knockback / death, morph keep byte |

Census after (2026-09-29, `cargo run -p rc-trace -- class-census`): no unit lists `creature`; 412 units / 3,681 created
instances unported (was 417 / 4,030 before this wave's two lanes); verdicts cheap 219 / 1,498, missing 145 / 1,884,
partly 42 / 291, unknown 6 / 8. Freed by this row (only the cheat left, conditional): 340 (04: 28), 333 (08: 8), 217
(04: 5), 578 (03: 3).

### In the port: W2 lane 2, help directors and quick wins (2026-09-29, level_scripting.md §8)

| unit (this run) | classes (levels) | port |
|---|---|---|
| U183 | 838 laser fences (05; 26) | `units/laser_fence.rs` + `Callback::UnitQuads` (G-AUD-010) |
| U32, U119, U145, U165, U204, U232, U292, U305, U341, U391, U419 | the help directors 1413 (00), 1324 (02), 1342 (03), 1343 (04), 1347 (05), 1348 (06), 1349 (08), 1000 (09), 1344 (10), 422 (12), 558 (13) | `units/help_*.rs`, `units/hints.rs` |

Re-tags (census_systems.tsv): `C:bcf4ccdaa994` (L04 `0x27eca0` = `PlayLevelSoundAtMoby`) has; `L01:0021e340`
`DrawSpriteHelper_A` has (VU1 set-up only); `X:855` has (the hand-off store is ported); `L01:00278020` has
(`HeightGrid::height`). Census before → after this lane (both runs include the other lanes' ports of the same
moment): 412 units / 3,681 created (cheap 219 / 1,498, partly 42 / 291, missing 145 / 1,884) → **397 / 3,454**
(cheap 217 / 1,532, partly 33 / 233, missing 141 / 1,681). Newly cheap: the 466 family (U154, 38), 855 (U189, 7),
the four sprite-callback units (U379, U384, U488, U532: 16). Found while porting: the save-only story classes also
write items, bolts and health directly (G-CLS-029), 558 writes the hero's airless flag 0x14161b (G-HERO-032).

### In the port: W2 lane 1, the ready enemy units (2026-09-29, creatures.md §10)

Census re-run after them (2026-09-29, with W2 lane 2's ports of the same day): **512** unported class-levels, 3,602
placed / **3,325 created** instances in **393 units** (verdicts cheap 217 / 1,532, missing 138 / 1,553, partly 32 /
232, unknown 6 / 8); these seven units took 319 created instances. Left of the lane's list: 1202 (57), 1199 (15),
1196 (7) on level 10 and 29 (9) on level 13 — 29 is three classes (the turret, its rider 36, its shot 1238: the last
two created by code, so outside the census). Findings for the census itself: `0x294cb0` / `0x265b38` is ported now
(`path::toward`); level13 `0x280400` is a type-68 spawner, not `PartType44Spawn` (G-PRT-007; U407 was "has
particles"); 568 is "cheap" but inert without 1422.

### In the port: G-HERO-002's consumers, and what it unblocked (2026-09-29, hero_states.md "Scripted control")

The hero states 0x1f / 0x32 / 0x78 are ported (`hero/scripted.rs`); the tags `G:001413d4=00000032` and the level
`SetState` copies (`C:8a18636e69bd`, `C:7b3e1e804b94`, `C:ea215dba76e7`, `C:2f2e9be4c73e`, `C:8cdb2fd899d9`,
`C:ec679874da9e`, `C:b73827d476e2`, `C:84d6abe16fc6`) are **has** (every state a class passes them is ported: 0, 6,
0x1e, 0x32, 0x3d, 0x72, 0x77, 0x78, 100, found by grepping every level's class code for its `SetState` copy); level 05 /
16's copies stay partly (the Hoverboard's 0x6b, G-HERO-008), the per-body idles partly (G-HERO-005).

| unit (this run's id) | classes (levels: created) | reference update | port |
|---|---|---|---|
| U216 | 1039 kill cuboids (06, 08, 13, 18: 4) | level06 0x2f7930 | `units::kill_volume` |
| U274 | 438 Batalia's circling fighters (08: 25) | level08 0x2de848 (+ trail 0x2dec90) | `units::batalia_fighter` |

**Now cheap for a class job (herostate cleared, census 2026-09-29):** 440 the Batalia turret (08: 1; the one portable
setter of 0x32, 1,606 words, entered by walking in once its mission byte is done, else from the Water Worker 1283,
which needs saves), 587 (18: 28), 336 (12: 11), 1150 / 1151 (09: 5), 1178 (11: 4), 1772 (17: 2; its 0x32 branch also
reads the ship moby: G-LVL-009), 263–267 (09: 1), 361 (11: 1), 388 (13: 1); partly: 347 (17: 8, anim). Cleared of
herostate but blocked elsewhere: the fighters 1843 / 1319 (the `shipmode` override), 1059 / 294 / 1231 (cheat),
the 0x32 setters 1201 / 1267 / 1242 / 69 / 1379 and 1380, 713, 1083, 21 / 244, 1270 (the type-5 script camera
`C:3b375f0ab07b`), 1106 (the Umbris boss, 0x78's setter: cheat, ptype, shadow).

Census re-run after them: `herostate` **66 → 34 units, 93 → 52 class-levels, 786 → 487 created** (the rest: the
bodies 1 / 2 / 3, the per-body idles, SwitchCharacter and leaving a body, G-HERO-005; the Hoverboard's 0x6b).

### In the port: W3, the remaining ready enemy units (2026-09-29, creatures.md §11)

| unit (this run's id) | classes (levels: created) | reference update | port |
|---|---|---|---|
| U335 | 1196 Orxon's path scouts (10: 7) | level10 0x2df270 | `units::orxon_flyers` (`update_1196`) |
| U336 | 1199 Orxon's swoop flyers (10: 15 of 51 placed) | level10 0x2e01a8 | `units::orxon_flyers` (`update_1199`) |
| U337 | 1202 Orxon's brawlers (10: 57 of 65 placed) | level10 0x2e1d38 | `units::orxon_brawler` |
| U407 / U408 / U424 | 29 Gemlik's gun turrets (13: 9), their rider 36 and shot 1238 (created by code: 0 placed) | level13 0x2b41b8, 0x2b4c80, 0x306300 | `units::gemlik_turret` |

Tag fixes: `C:dc2339668382` (the next waypoint toward a target, L09 / L13 / L15) is **has** (`path::toward`); level13
`0x280400` has its own row `C:29928a61391b`: a **type-68** spawner (`particles::type68`, G-PRT-007 closed the same day), not `PartType44Spawn` (its code shares
nothing with L01 0x286450; the old "has particles" of U407 came from the CreatePart copy it calls). New rows: level13
`0x26a498` = `SpawnBeamExplosion` (`C:d7574994a069`, has), `0x265af0` the hit-record writer (`C:c294ae52ce36`, has),
the type-51 spawner `C:70fa5037a649` (L07 / L13 / L14, has: `particles::type51`), the scorch `C:98f51a1cea64` (L10 / L12 /
L13, has: `explosive_tank::scorch`).

Census re-run after them (2026-09-29, with the day's other ports): **480** unported class-levels, 3,188 placed /
**2,955 created** instances in **375 units** (verdicts cheap 214 / 1,333, missing 134 / 1,465, partly 21 / 149,
unknown 6 / 8); these four units took 88 created instances (4 class-levels, plus the two created-by-code classes the
census now lists as ported rows). The lane's list is done: nothing of G-ENM-010's "ready" list is left.

### In the port: cheap wins round 2 (2026-09-29, G-CLS-027)

Taken in the census's order by created instances (unit ids of the 2026-09-29 13:49 run; the re-run renumbers them),
all levels. Each unit is a row (or rows) of `units::PORTS`; the coverage table of every ported function (each call,
branch and side effect, with its port or its gap) is the module doc of the port; tests
`rc-game/tests/classes/cheap_classes_c.rs` (every unit resolves on exactly its census levels with the census's created
counts, and runs headless on one of them covering its side-effect rows) and the unit tests in each module.

| unit | classes (levels: created) | reference | port | notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| U480 | 408 alarms (15, 17: 48) | level15 0x2cb4c8 | `units::quartu_alarm` | state machine, pulsing light, the level's alarm word, fade, loop sound 5, drone release; the family call `set_off` (0x2cbac0) is made by the guards 44 (unported); the full-screen tint's colour is ported (`tint`), its draw is **G-REN-030** |
| U470 | 77 alarm drones (15, 17: 36) | level15 0x2a2488 | `units::quartu_drone` | released by 408 (`release` 0x2a2868), rise, home, explode (death explosion + sphere hit 0x10001), type-60 sparks, the group glow (`Callback::UnitQuads`, 0x2a29b8) |
| U474 | 123 swinging lasers (15, 17: 46) | level15 0x2a6e68 | `units::swing_laser` | circle / slide / pendulum paths; the beam: a template line hit (0x10001), a world line, 40 type-60 sparks a tick, a camera-facing quad (0x2a7628) |
| U411 | 127, 128, 159, 169 rotators (13: 24) | level13 0x2c7f38 | `units::linked_rotator` | the turning twin of `linked_mover` (U247): same pvar layout, `linked_mover::link_state` shared |
| U215 | 1038 orb holders (06, 10, 17: 21) + the orb 1040 they create | level06 0x2f7288 / 0x2f7ab8 | `units::orb_holder` | the glow is the gold bolts' item glow with other data (`gold_bolt::glow_init_with` / `item_glow_with`, third consumer); death bits both ways |
| U503 / U502 / U514 | 552 barrier posts (16: 20), 546 switches (6), 1387 walls (4) | level16 0x2cf4a8 / 0x2cf198 / 0x2e36e8 | `units::kalebo_barrier` | one family: posts pair by height, beams (`Callback::UnitQuads`), loop 0; switches turn the wall's collision, re-arm |
| U185 | 843 sliding blocks (05: 16) | level05 0x30e508 | `units::cuboid_slider` | placed by a cuboid; `turn::spring` |
| U473 | 93 swing doors (15: 12) | level15 0x2a3ba8 | `units::swing_door` | cuboids for Ratchet, the camera and the run list's targetable mobys (the run list rebuilt per door [L]) |
| U307 | 1172 chain anchors (09: 10) | level09 0x303d10 | `units::chain_anchor` | the chain end of `chain_link` (U303); resolver, flash, `SetDeathBits`, the break passed on, beam explosion |
| U477 | 196, 197, 1958 sliding doors (15, 17: 10) | level15 0x2bddb0 | `units::slide_door` | |

**Not cheap after all** (a system the census does not see): U171 (133, 05: 20) adds `ticks(60)` to the hoverboard
boost timer 0x13fc14 when Ratchet hits it (G-HERO-008 / G-LVL-007); U510 (933, 16: 25) reads the hero capsule's contact
moby 0x13f58c (G-HERO-033) and resolves damage on a stack record; U281 (468 / 469, 08: 10) ramps its loop's volume
(`SoundSetVolume` 0x2a1968, tagged has L, but no `SoundSink` method: G-AUD-011); U326 (939, 10: 11) launches the
class 938 it creates (0x2d85c8: its bounce 0x2d8170 and the engine 0x24d508, outside the census: G-CLS-001);
1143 (16: 10) and 823 (05, 07: 8) attach a manipulator to a class joint list (the list target is not loaded for class
mobys: G-HERO-009); 1378 (10, 17: 6) writes the airless flag 0x14161b (G-HERO-032). **Census false positives**: U127
(03: 246, the flyer variant: G-CLS-028 / G-CLS-026, see the path units above) and U40 (class 27, 01: 10, run as an
external). **Deferred for size** (reached, not attempted): U154 (the 466 family, 04: 38, 3,032 words), U325 (857, 10:
31, 4,300 words), U499 (471, 16: 37: its own scrolling draw and a voice handoff), U561 (1355, 18: 36: two draw
callbacks), U535 (99, 17: 35), 1210 (03: `CarryRiders` with a rotation change, not ported), U488 / U532 (the
sprite-callback units: their draws are environment meshes, level15 0x2eac90 …). Reached down the list to the units of 10 instances; the rest of the appendix is open.

Tools: `rc-trace overlay-diff` now prints the counterpart address of identical cells too (`= addr`), which gives a
level-address → level-01 map for any list of functions (used here to name every call of a unit's decomp).

Census before → after (both `cargo run -p rc-trace -- class-census`; the "after" run includes the other lanes' ports
of the same afternoon): 393 units / 3,325 created (cheap 217 / 1,532) → **375 units / 2,955 created** (cheap 223 /
1,365, missing 125 / 1,432, partly 20 / 147, unknown 7 / 11). This round: 13 unit rows, 253 created instances.

## Unique classes: the ones that need something no other class needs

A blocking function (missing or partly) that exactly one unit calls:

| unit | classes | levels | created | its own blocker [system] |
|---|---|---|---|---|

| U218 | 1051 | 06 | 1 | `L01:003137b0` FUN_003137b0 [camera] |

Besides these, the unit-private code of the big units is by definition unique: U118 (level 03's nine 75..132 / 795
classes, 246 instances, 1,820 words behind one update `0x29dba8`), U198 (827, 2,150 words), U359 (1246, 1,924 words),
U15 (749, 1,736 words) and U289 (193, 1,636 words) are the largest.

## Classes the census could not resolve

6 units / 8 instances have no missing function but call an untagged one (the function was not read; all rare). 14
more units already have a known blocker and also call an untagged function (listed in the appendix as "untagged ×n").

| unit | classes | levels | created | verdict | untagged shared functions |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| U144 | 1012 | 03 | 2 | unknown | `C:f638735f808a` (FUN_002d3918) |
| U344 | 1424 | 10 | 2 | unknown | `C:ecc426044254` (FUN_002f5a50) |
| U343 | 1421 | 10 | 1 | unknown | `C:ecc426044254` (FUN_002f5a50) |
| U451 | 921 | 14 | 1 | unknown | `C:ecc426044254` (FUN_002f5a50) |
| U458 | 1352 | 14 | 1 | unknown | `C:ecc426044254` (FUN_002f5a50) |
| U568 | 1563 | 18 | 1 | unknown | `L01:002d2d08` (FUN_002d2d08) |

Eight units call **no shared function at all** (U93 331, U107 743, U114 854, U143 997, U202 1099, U321 353, U417 533,
U464 1418): pure class code, counted as cheap.

### Untagged shared functions (for a later pass)

Key, a level copy, units calling it, created instances of those units, size in words. `C:` keys are cluster hashes
(`tools/ghidra/names/clusters.tsv` lists every copy). 13 left (43 before 2026-09-29): `C:7a28b0d324fa` is a one-call
wrapper whose callee differs per copy (the cluster hash masks it), `boot:001251e8` has no decompiler entry (between
`sce_vib_get_profile` and `sce_vu0_unit_matrix`), the rest were not read.
