# Workflow: testing (tiers, areas, the test audit)

What runs when, which tests belong to which area, and the audit of every test in the workspace (2026-09-29). All
commands run from the repo root with `export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/rustup/bin:$PATH"`. Tests that need game data
skip themselves when `extracted/` is absent.

**No test relies on the user's personal files** (§10): not the disc image, savestates, PCSX2 traces, screen
recordings, the settings file or session output in `work/`, not even "skip if missing". Tests read `extracted/`
through the data root and committed fixtures; findings from personal material reach them only as a few distilled
numbers. `guards::no_test_or_product_file_references_personal_paths` enforces it.

## 1. Commands that share the dev build

**Tests run only through `cargo xtask test-*`.** Never run `cargo test` or `cargo nextest` directly: there is no
Cargo test alias, and the xtask commands pass the one flag set that shares the dev Bevy build
(`--workspace --features rc-engine/dev`). Compile checks use the `.cargo/config.toml` aliases:

| What | Command |
|---|---|
| All unit tests (every crate's `src/` tests; rc-engine's live in the `randcrw` bin) | `cargo xtask test-quick` |
| One crate's unit tests | `cargo xtask test-quick <crate>` (e.g. `rc-formats`) |
| A job's tier (§2.1) | `cargo xtask test-job <area…> [shared]` |
| One or more integration binaries alone (the binaries of §3) | `cargo xtask test-job --test <binary> [--test <binary> …]` |
| One former test file | `cargo xtask test-job --test <binary> --filter <module>::` |
| One test | `cargo xtask test-job --test <binary> --filter <module>::<test_fn> --exact`, or a substring: `cargo xtask test-job --test hero --filter novalis_hero_digest` |
| Ignored surveys, with their output | add `--ignored --nocapture` (e.g. `cargo xtask test-job --test classes --filter creature_classes:: --ignored --nocapture`) |
| Type check of everything, with tests | `cargo check-all` |
| Lints | `cargo clippy-all` |
| Full suite | `cargo xtask test-full` |

The `cargo xtask test-*` commands set `RC_AUDIO=0` (other variables such as `RC_SNAPSHOT_WRITE=1` pass through) and
run through cargo-nextest when it is installed, else through `cargo test --workspace --features rc-engine/dev` (§8).
`--filter`, `--exact`, `--ignored` and `--nocapture` mean the same under both runners. The integration binaries are one
per area (§3), each with one module per former test file, so a test's path is `<module>::<test_fn>`, e.g.
`hero_novalis::novalis_hero_digest` in the binary `hero`.

Why no by-hand runs: `cargo test -p rc-game --lib` resolved other features and recompiled rc-formats and rc-game from
scratch (32 s, measured 2026-09-29) next to the shared copy; plain `cargo test --workspace` rebuilds Bevy statically;
and the old `cargo test-all` alias silently ran the whole workspace when given `-p <crate>` (removed 2026-09-29).
`cargo xtask test-quick` was up to date in 0.4 s after a full run.

## 2. Tiers

Two tiers.

### 2.1 Per job

Each brief names its areas, for example "areas: weapons, classes". The job runs:

1. **Unit tests:** `cargo xtask test-quick` (`--lib --bins`), every crate. The whole run takes about 5 s, and it is the only
   cheap way to cover a dependency change, so it is not split by area.
2. **The area groups** of §3, for each area the job touched.
3. **The shared-code guard set**, when the job touched shared code (§2.3):
   - Ratchet's NO_IDLE digest. **A change detector, not a correctness check:** it pins the port's current hero
     behaviour, which is known to be imperfect, so a match says "nothing moved", never "the movement is right". It
     must be byte-identical to the baseline, unless the brief changes hero behaviour on purpose. Movement correctness
     will come from distilled PCSX2 values in the (deferred) hero feel pass (docs/plan/hero_feel_pass.md). The test
     runs with the package as its working directory, so give it absolute paths:

     `cargo xtask test-job … shared` does this (it writes `work/test-results/digest_job.txt` with
     `RC_HERO_DIGEST` and `RC_HERO_DIGEST_NO_IDLE=1` and compares it byte for byte with the baseline).

     The baseline `work/test-results/hero_digest_no_idle.txt` is local: git-ignored (`/work/`), never committed,
     and written only by `cargo xtask digest-baseline`, which prints what changed. Run it only when a human has decided a digest change is
     intended, or when there is no baseline yet (a job takes one before its first edit). `test-job shared` and
     `test-full` only compare with it, and fail on a mismatch. A test that rewrote its own reference on every run
     would bake regressions in.
   - `all_levels_smoke::` in `world` (also part of `test-job shared`): 19 levels × 600 ticks and Gemlik × 3000 (about 26 s).
4. **`cargo check-all`** once at the end, and `cargo clippy-all` for the job's files (as before).

The report lists every command run and its result.

### 2.2 Full suite

`cargo xtask test-full` runs only:
- on merge to main;
- for a big shared-code commit, when the coordinator decides it.

The coordinator runs it through the commit agent and writes `work/test-results/latest.txt` (time, HEAD,
`git status --short`, per-suite counts, failures). The same run compares the NO_IDLE digest with the baseline (§2.1)
and fails on a mismatch; it never rewrites the baseline. The last full run
(2026-09-29 02:52, before the merge) took about 9 min of test time (520 s summed over the suites, before
`creature_classes` was added); `water_levels` alone took 176 s. After the merge job (§5) the full suite under nextest
takes 139 s (1167 run, 26 ignored).

### 2.3 What counts as shared code

Shared code is code that every level or every tick runs through. A change to it can break areas the job did not name.
- **rc-game:** `tick.rs`, `lib.rs`, `hero.rs` and the hero core (`hero/{physics,states,common,anim,ground,walk,jump,air,damage}.rs`), `pad.rs`, `follow_camera*`, `collision_query*`, `rng.rs`, `ps2v.rs`, `moby_runtime.rs`, `moby_update.rs`, `moby_update/{scheduler,services,interact,triggers}.rs`, `moby_update/classes/mod.rs` (the `LevelPorts` registry), `particles.rs` (the dispatcher).
- **rc-formats:** the level loaders every level uses (`level`, `gameplay`, `moby`, `collision`, `wad`, `level_overlay`, `test_data`).
- **rc-engine:** the level load and the main loop. These tests do not reach rc-engine; there, the screenshot rules of the brief are the check.

## 3. Area map (per-job groups)

The unit tests of every area run in step 1 of §2.1. The table lists each area's integration binary and its modules
(the former test files, merged 2026-09-29, §5): `cargo xtask test-job --test <binary>`, or add
`--filter <module>::` for one module. `cargo xtask test-job <area…>` runs the unit tests plus the listed binaries; its area table is `AREAS`
in `tools/xtask/src/test.rs`, which this table documents (area names and aliases are the same).

Aliases: creatures and mobys → `classes`; levels, collision and water → `world`; menus, HUD, map, save and vendor → `ui`;
movies → `video`; render and input → `engine`; fx → `particles`; guards and layout → `repo`.
Wall times: the 2026-09-29 full run before the merge, summed over the old binaries; for `classes` and `world` also
the merged binary under `cargo test` (per-binary caches, §5).

| Area | Modules (former test files) | Binary | Unit-test modules (in the lib) | Wall time |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| hero | `hero_boots_grind` `hero_boots_magnet` `hero_cable_kerwan` `hero_damage` `hero_followups` `hero_ledge_novalis` `hero_novalis` `hero_pack_swap_novalis` `hero_packs_novalis` `hero_platform_novalis` `hero_surfaces` `hero_swingshot_levels` | `hero` | `hero::*` except the weapon modules, `follow_camera`, `pad`, `afterimage` | ~8 s |
| weapons | `hero_doom` `hero_gameplay_novalis` `hero_gloves` `hero_guns_novalis` `hero_morph` `hero_pyrocitor_novalis` `hero_reactive_novalis` `hero_targeting_novalis` `hero_visibomb` `hero_weapons4` `hero_weapons_novalis` | `weapons` | `hero::{blaster,comet,devastator,guns,melee,morph_ray,pyrocitor,ryno,suck_cannon,suck_vortex,tesla,walloper,weapons,…}`, `targeting` | ~8 s |
| classes | `bolt_crank_novalis` `breakables_levels` `cheap_classes_a` `cheap_classes_b` `common_classes_levels` `creature_classes` `creatures_enemies_novalis` `creatures_novalis` `explosion_survey` `gold_bolt_infobot_novalis` `moby_update_novalis` `path_classes` | `classes` | `moby_update::*` (classes, creature, units), `moby_runtime`, `path`, `spline` | ~200 s before; 14 s merged |
| world | `all_levels_smoke` `cutscene_novalis` `level_ports` `moby_collision_novalis` `novalis_collision` `novalis_world` `sea_levels` `shadow_volume_novalis` `water_levels` | `world` | `particles::*`, `water::*`, `shadows::*`, `collision_query`, `fog_zones`, `point_lights`, `sky_stars`, `cinematic`, `rng`, `ps2v` | ~290 s before; 32 s merged |
| ui | `gadgets_novalis` `game_state_novalis` `gemlik_generalisation` `help_novalis` `interaction_vendor` `map_levels` `pause_pages_novalis` `reverb_conformance` `sound_conformance` | `ui` | `menus::*`, `map::*`, `hud`, `help`, `game_state`, `inventory`, `movie_player`, `scene_player` | ~8 s |
| audio | `reverb_conformance` `sound_conformance` (in `ui`), plus `weapons -- --exact hero_guns_novalis::novalis_ryno_salvo_sounds_mix_without_overflow` | in `ui`: `--test ui -- reverb_conformance:: sound_conformance::` | `audio::*` | ~3 s |
| formats | `golden` `level_overlay_disc` `moby_anim_golden` `moby_collision_disc` `moby_shadow_disc` `occlusion_frames` `scene_coverage` `tfrag_light_golden` (rc-formats) | `formats` | rc-formats lib | ~6 s |
| data | `lifecycle` `roundtrip` (rc-data) | `data` | rc-data lib | ~3 s |
| extract (extractor, launcher side) | `synthetic` (rc-extract; the checks against a real disc are `rc-trace disc-check`, §10) | `extract` | rc-extract lib and bin | <1 s |
| video | `movies` (rc-video) | `movies` | rc-video lib | <1 s |
| engine (render, input, engine glue) | none | — | the `randcrw` bin's tests | — |
| particles (alias fx; added 2026-09-29) | `particle_consumers` (in `classes`: the ported classes' particle types living their lives) | in `classes`: `--test classes --filter particle_consumers::` | `particles::*` (listed under world; every job runs the unit tests) | ~5 s |
| trace tools | `hero_replay_selfcheck` `novalis_spawn` `synthetic` (tools/trace) | `trace` | rc-trace lib | ~2 s |
| repo layout (new crates, dependencies, top-level files) | `guards` (tools/repo-checks) | `guards` | — | <1 s |
| shared code (§2.3; area `shared`) | the guard set of §2.1: `hero -- --exact hero_novalis::novalis_hero_digest` (digest compare) and `world -- all_levels_smoke::` | — | — | ~27 s |

A brief with "areas: weapons, classes" runs `cargo xtask test-job weapons classes`: the unit tests plus
`--test weapons --test classes`. The areas `engine` (unit tests only) and `repo` (`guards`) and the aliases are in
`cargo xtask help`.

## 4. A separate canary set?

No (decided 2026-09-29). The unit tests plus the shared-code guard set (`cargo xtask test-job shared`: digest and
`all_levels_smoke`, about 30 s) are the canary. The coordinator runs them once more when it commits a batch of
several jobs without the full suite; that catches cross-area breakage that each job's own areas miss. A hand-picked
list would drift out of date with every new port.

## 5. The merge (done 2026-09-29)

The 70 integration binaries are now 11. Each group is `tests/<group>/main.rs` with one `mod` per former file, so every
test keeps its name as `<file>::<test_fn>` (the two repeated names, `units_resolve_on_their_levels` and `survey`, stay
apart). rc-video's `movies.rs` and repo-checks' `guards.rs` were already one binary each and stay where they are.

| Crate | Before | Binaries now |
|---|---|---|
| rc-game | 53 | 5: `hero`, `weapons`, `classes`, `world`, `ui` (audio is inside `ui`) |
| rc-formats | 8 | 1: `formats` (with `formats/snapshot/mod.rs`, the snapshot table writer) |
| rc-data | 2 | 1: `data` |
| rc-extract | 2 | 1: `extract` |
| rc-video | 1 | 1: `movies` (unchanged) |
| repo-checks | 1 | 1: `guards` (unchanged) |
| tools/trace | 3 | 1: `trace` |

What changed besides the moves (no test function or assertion changed):
- **Per-process caches** in `crates/rc-game/tests/common/mod.rs` (`#[path = "../common/mod.rs"] mod common;` in
  `classes` and `world`): the parsed level overlays, the per-level `LevelPorts` (keyed by level and external list),
  and the per-level `LevelWaterData`. The files' own `overlay` / `ports` / `water_data` helpers now return clones of
  the cached values; four in-body `LevelPorts::from_overlays(overlay(level), overlay, &[])` calls
  (`gold_bolt_infobot_novalis`, `sea_levels` ×2, `all_levels_smoke::run_level`) call the same cache. Checked: the
  printed per-level output of `gold_bolt_infobot_novalis` and `sea_levels` is byte-identical before and after, and
  the NO_IDLE hero digest is identical.
- **The four no-assert surveys are `#[ignore]`** (§6); `--ignored` still runs them.
- **Paths:** the fixture `include_str!` of `shadow_volume_novalis` (`../fixtures/`), repo-checks' `KNOWN_OFFENDERS`,
  and the `tests/<file>.rs` / `--test <file>` references in the sources, docs and README now name the merged paths.
- **Heat:** a merged binary runs all its tests on every core under `cargo test`; cap it with `RUST_TEST_THREADS=4`.
  nextest is capped at 8 threads (§8).

Measured (M-series laptop, 2026-09-29, the dev build shared through the aliases):

| | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| Integration binaries | 70 | 11 |
| The test build (`--no-run`, workspace, dev features) after touching `crates/rc-game/src/lib.rs` (warm) | 20.4 s | 10.4 s |
| The integration binaries on disk (executables + `.dSYM`) | 2.2 GB | 0.46 GB |
| `du -sh target` | 11 GB | 13 GB, of which 3.2 GB are the 68 stale old binaries and their incremental state (`cargo clean` drops them); about 9.8 GB without them |
| `classes` + `world` under `cargo test` | ~490 s summed (200 + 290) | 14 s + 32 s |
| `water_levels::water_inventory_all_levels` | 167 s | 48.5 s (nextest, under full-suite load) |
| Full suite | ~520 s summed test time (`cargo test`, 87 suites, run one after another) | 139 s wall (`cargo xtask test-full`, nextest, 8 threads) |

Under nextest every test is its own process, so the caches only save the repeated parses inside one test; the
13 tests that scan all 19 levels each still build their own `LevelPorts` (30–52 s each under load). Under `cargo test`
they share one build per binary: `classes` and `world` then take 46 s together, so a `cargo xtask test-full --cargo-test` run is
estimated at about 90 s with far less CPU (not measured: the job allowed one full run).

## 6. Slow tests and tests that look wrong

**Slow** (over 10 s each; all others are under ~3 s). "Before": the old binaries under `cargo test`. "Nextest": the
2026-09-29 full run after the merge, one process per test with 8 running at once, so the times include contention;
under `cargo test` the merged binaries share one `LevelPorts` build per level (§5).

| Test | Before | Nextest |
|---|---|---|
| `water_levels::water_inventory_all_levels` | 167 s | 48.5 s (`water_data` cached per level) |
| `level_ports::every_level_runs_the_ports_its_class_table_names` | ~45 s | 34.9 s |
| `breakables_levels::every_placed_breakable_breaks_on_its_level` and `every_breakable_class_resolves_its_data_on_every_level` | ~25–48 s | 40.0 s, 39.3 s |
| the four `units_resolve_on_their_levels` | 22–24 s each | 37–39 s each |
| `common_classes_levels::common_classes_resolve_on_their_levels` | ~25 s | 39.2 s |
| `gold_bolt_infobot_novalis::registered_on_the_levels_with_identical_code` | ~22 s | 36.9 s |
| `sea_levels::sea_inventory_all_levels` and `sea_ports_run_on_their_levels` | ~20–44 s | 52.1 s, 30.0 s |
| `all_levels_smoke::all_levels_load_spawn_and_tick` | ~26 s | 40.0 s |
| `water_levels::managers_run_on_their_levels` | 12.7 s | 21.7 s |

**Look wrong or weak.** No flaky or order-dependent test was seen: every test is headless, the determinism checks pass
run to run, and the merged binaries (all tests in one process under `cargo test`) and nextest (one process per test)
give the same results.
- `breakables_levels::novalis_breaks_every_breakable_kind`: `assert!((4..=7).contains(&got) || got > 0)`. The range
  half is vacuous; only `got > 0` is checked.
- `hero_surfaces::novalis_flow_surface_is_the_sinking_floor`: the doc says the flow class 679 "is not ported". It is,
  since `hero_followups`. The test is still valid, because its harness runs no mobys; only the doc is stale.
- `guards::top_level_holds_only_the_agreed_folders` fails while a user screen recording sits in the repo root. This is
  expected, but it turns every full run red.

**Surveys that assert nothing** (`#[ignore]` since 2026-09-29; run them with `--ignored --nocapture`):
- `creature_classes::survey_pvars`
- `creature_classes::survey_tables`
- `gemlik_generalisation::gemlik_content_gap` (it builds Gemlik's ports, ~1 s)
- `moby_lod::novalis_metal_classes` (rc-engine)

`bolt_crank_novalis::{probe_placement, write_engine_script}` return at once unless their environment variable is set.

## 7. The audit

### 7.1 Method

Each row carries four fields.
- **Pin kind.** What the test holds fixed:
  - **game-checked:** behaviour on real game data, with its address when the test or its doc cites one;
  - **regression:** a bug it once caught, or a refactor guard;
  - **determinism:** a second identical run;
  - **data/format:** a loader, snapshot or table invariant;
  - **exists/resolves:** registry, resolve and "loads" smoke checks;
  - **repo guard;**
  - **port logic:** the port's own code on a synthetic fixture. The module cites the decomp; the test does not;
  - **survey / dev helper:** asserts nothing.

  "+ determinism" marks a behaviour test that also asserts a second identical run (84 tests).
- **Fixture.** In brackets: a level (L01 = Novalis), "all levels", "disc data" or synthetic.
- **Runtime.** Estimated from the code (levels loaded, `LevelPorts` builds, ticks), calibrated on the suite times of
  the 2026-09-29 full run. The bracketed times were measured one binary at a time with
  `RUSTC_BOOTSTRAP=1 <test binary> --test-threads=1 -Z unstable-options --report-time`, which needs no rebuild; this
  was done for `creature_classes`, `cheap_classes_a` and `water_levels`.
  - **fast:** under 1 s.
  - **medium:** 1–10 s. Usually one level's `LevelPorts` (~1.1 s), or a 19-level parse.
  - **slow:** over 10 s. The 19-level `LevelPorts` scans.

  Unit tests are all fast: each crate's lib runs in under 1.5 s.
- **Group.** The merge group of §5. For unit tests it is `lib:<area>`, the area whose module the test lives in.

### 7.2 Counts

| | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| Tests (`#[test]` fns) | 1188 | 1186 |
| Integration binaries | 70 | 70; 11 after the merge job (§5) |

| Crate | Unit before → after | Integration before → after | Binaries | `#[ignore]` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| rc-game | 564 → 564 | 286 → 284 | 53 (5 after the merge) | 17 (20 after the merge job: 3 surveys) |
| rc-formats | 147 → 147 | 34 → 34 | 8 | 0 |
| rc-engine | 67 → 67 | 0 | 0 | 0 (1 after the merge job: 1 survey) |
| rc-data | 5 → 5 | 6 → 6 | 2 | 0 |
| rc-extract | 24 → 24 | 5 → 5 | 2 | 3 |
| rc-video | 8 → 8 | 3 → 3 | 1 | 2 |
| tools/trace | 21 → 21 | 5 → 5 | 3 | 0 |
| tools/repo-checks | 0 | 5 → 5 | 1 | 0 |
| tools/xtask | 8 → 8 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

Pin kinds after the drops (1186 tests):

| Pin kind | Tests |
|---|---|
| port logic | 643 |
| game-checked | 370 |
| data/format | 99 |
| exists/resolves | 25 |
| survey (ignored) | 22 |
| determinism | 9 (plus 84 behaviour tests that also assert it) |
| regression | 7 |
| repo guard | 5 |
| survey (no assert) | 4 (ignored since the merge job: 26 ignored in all) |
| dev helper | 2 |

### 7.3 Dropped (2)

- **`gemlik_generalisation::gemlik_class_table_runs_the_body_pieces`.** A duplicate: it built Gemlik's `LevelPorts`
  and asserted that classes 1733–1735 and 1801–1804 run `FxPiece`.
  `level_ports::every_level_runs_the_ports_its_class_table_names` asserts the same seven classes, with the same
  `FxPiece` check, on the same L13 overlay.
- **`hero_surfaces::surface_ids_per_level`.** A superseded survey: it printed `surfaces(n)` for all 19 levels and
  asserted nothing. `hero_surfaces::every_level_handles_its_own_surfaces` runs the same `surfaces(n)` on every level
  and asserts on its result.

### 7.3a Moved out of the suite (4, 2026-09-29)

They read the user's disc image (`RC_ISO`, else the ISO in the personal folder), which no test may do (§10). The same
checks, unchanged, are the dev command `cargo run --release -p rc-trace -- disc-check`:
- `formats golden::disc_matches_extracted_for_every_level` (check 1);
- `ui game_state_novalis::disc_save_game_lump_matches_extracted` (check 2);
- `extract golden::builtin_table_matches_the_disc` (check 3; was `#[ignore]`);
- `extract golden::extract_matches_the_committed_table` (check 4, with `--extract-into <scratch dir>`; was `#[ignore]`).

The tables below are the audit as taken, minus these four rows.

## 8. cargo-nextest and the xtask tier commands

**Install** (once): `cargo install cargo-nextest --locked` (0.9.146 on 2026-09-29). It lands in `~/.cargo/bin`
(`CARGO_HOME`), which is not on this machine's `PATH`; `cargo nextest …` still works because cargo looks in
`$CARGO_HOME/bin` for subcommands. Only calling `cargo-nextest` directly needs the folder on `PATH` (fish:
`fish_add_path ~/.cargo/bin`; zsh: `export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"` in `~/.zprofile`).

**Never by hand:** the xtask commands call `cargo nextest run --workspace --features rc-engine/dev …` (the flags
that reuse the dev (dynamic) Bevy build) with the right target flags and filterset; every targeted need has an option
(§1), so neither `cargo nextest` nor `cargo test` is run directly.

**Settings:** `.config/nextest.toml`, profile `default`:
- `fail-fast = false`;
- a test is flagged SLOW after 30 s (and every 30 s after); nothing is killed;
- `test-threads = 8`, the same cap as the build's `jobs = 8`;
- the final summary lists the slow and failed tests again;
- test group `loader-snapshots` (one at a time): the rc-formats `golden::` tests, which rewrite one shared file
  (`crates/rc-formats/data/loader_snapshots.tsv`) under `RC_SNAPSHOT_WRITE=1`. Under `cargo test` a mutex serialises
  them; nextest's one process per test defeats the mutex. No other test shares a file or an environment variable:
  the temp folders carry the process id and the test name, no test calls `set_var`, and the `RC_*` variables are
  only read.

**Doctests:** none (every lib's `Doc-tests` runs 0), so the nextest runs miss nothing. When one appears, add
a `cargo test --workspace --features rc-engine/dev --doc` step to `test-full` (`full_steps` in `tools/xtask/src/test.rs`).

**Determinism:** the shared guard set (`cargo xtask test-job shared`, 851 tests plus the digest) was run twice under
nextest on 2026-09-29: all passed both times, and the two NO_IDLE digests are byte-identical to each other and to
the baseline taken before the merge.

**The commands** (`cargo xtask help`; `tools/xtask/README.md`):

| Command | Runs |
|---|---|
| `cargo xtask test-quick [crate]` | the unit tests (`--lib --bins`); with nextest a crate name narrows it (`-E package(<crate>)`) |
| `cargo xtask test-job <area…>` | the unit tests and the areas' binaries of §3 in one nextest run (a filterset for the partial areas `audio` and `shared`); with `shared`, then the digest compare |
| `cargo xtask test-job --test <binary>…` | those integration binaries alone (`--test <binary>`; no unit tests, no digest); next to areas, added to them |
| `cargo xtask test-full` | the whole suite with `--no-fail-fast`, then the digest compared with the baseline (a mismatch fails), then `cargo xtask sweep` (§9; only warns) |
| `cargo xtask digest-baseline` | the only writer of the baseline; prints what changed. Run it only when a human has decided the digest change is intended |

Targeting options of `test-quick` and `test-job`: `--filter <name>` (a test-path substring, repeatable; nextest
`-E test(<name>)` ANDed with the selection, libtest's positional filter), `--exact` (full paths: `test(=…)`,
libtest `--exact`), `--ignored` (`--run-ignored only`, libtest `--ignored`), `--nocapture` (`--no-capture`). A
filtered or `--ignored` `test-job shared` skips the digest. Under `--cargo-test` a filter replaces a partial area's own
module filters (libtest ORs filters), so it applies to that whole binary.

Each sets `RC_AUDIO=0`; `--cargo-test` uses `cargo test --workspace --features rc-engine/dev` instead of nextest;
arguments after `--` go to nextest as is (or to the test binaries under `cargo test`). The runner choice matters for the level scans: see the end of §5.

## 9. Keeping target/ small

`target/` grows with every feature set, profile and stale test binary (13–16 GB on 2026-09-29; the static-Bevy
mistakes of §1 roughly double it). `cargo xtask sweep` keeps it under a limit, **30 GB by default**
(`--limit 20G`, `--limit 500MB`, `--limit 2GiB`; G/GB are decimal), with cargo-sweep
(`cargo install cargo-sweep --locked`, 0.8.0 on 2026-09-29; like nextest it lands in `~/.cargo/bin` and `cargo sweep`
finds it there).

* **What goes:** while `target/` holds more file bytes than the limit, the least recently used build units, oldest
  first: a unit is one `.fingerprint/<name>-<hash>` with its `deps/` and `build/` files, and "used" is the newest access
  time of its fingerprint files (cargo reads them on every build that includes the unit). What the dev loop and the
  tests used last stays, so `cargo dev` does not rebuild Bevy. It never touches `incremental/` (not tracked by
  fingerprints; about half of `target/`) or unhashed outputs such as `target/debug/randcrw`.
* **Safety:** it refuses (exit 1) while another `cargo`, `rustc` or `cargo-nextest` runs, so it never deletes files
  under a running build; the `cargo` running the xtask itself does not count. Without cargo-sweep it prints the install
  line and exits 0.
* **Output:** `target/` before and after, and the units removed. `--dry-run` shows what it would remove.
* **When it runs:** at the end of `cargo xtask test-full` (a refusal or failure there only warns; the test result
  stands), after the coordinator's commit, and by hand whenever.
* **Full reset:** `cargo clean` (then the next `cargo dev` rebuilds everything, Bevy included: minutes, not seconds).
  It is also the only way to drop a big stale `incremental/`.

## 10. Personal files: none in tests (2026-09-29)

**The rule.** No test relies on the user's personal files, not even optionally or "skip if missing". Personal means:
anything in the personal folder (the disc image, savestates, PCSX2 traces), screen recordings, the user's settings
file, anything in `work/` that came from the user's own sessions, and any other file that exists only on the user's
machine. Tests may read `extracted/` through the data root (`rc_formats::test_data::root`, `RC_EXTRACTED`) like the rest
of the suite, and committed fixtures. Findings from personal material reach tests only as small distilled values: a
handful of numbers inline, or a tiny committed fixture (e.g. `crates/rc-game/tests/fixtures/shadow_ratchet_novalis_idle.tsv`).
No gameplay logs, trace dumps or savestate excerpts are committed. Provenance comments name the source in words
("distilled from the user's PCSX2 savestate of 2026-09-26"), never with a path.

**The guard.** `tools/repo-checks` (`guards::no_test_or_product_file_references_personal_paths`) scans every file under
`crates/` and every tool's `tests/` folder for the personal patterns (`.p2s`, `~/PS2`, `PS2/ratchet1`, `work/`,
`/traces/`, `RC_PERSONAL`), and test files additionally for the disc-image and home-folder hooks (`RC_ISO`, `HOME`,
`home_dir`). It has no allow-list. Tool sources (`tools/*/src`) are not scanned: tools read personal material on
purpose (`rc-trace` savestates and recordings, `xtask regen-data` the disc image).

**Disc checks (by hand).** What needs the disc image is a dev command, not a test:

```
cargo run --release -p rc-trace -- disc-check [--iso IMAGE] [--extracted DIR] [--extract-into SCRATCH]
```

1. the disc reader (`rc_formats::disc`) against `extracted/` on all 19 levels (every lump, the audio/scene lumps, the
   TOC, the boot ELF), with per-level read times;
2. the disc's `save_game` lump against `extracted/global/save_game.bin`, and the card folder `SYSTEM.CNF` names;
3. the extractor's size/SHA-1 table hashed from the image against `crates/rc-extract/data/scus_971_99.tsv` (run it after
   regenerating the table with `randcrw-extract table`);
4. with `--extract-into`: a full and an `--ntsc-only` extraction (~7 GiB; delete afterwards) hold exactly the table's
   files and verify.

The image defaults to `RC_ISO`, else the ISO in the personal folder. Run it after a change to `rc_formats::disc`,
`iso9660` or the extractor.

## 11. The loader golden tests and the build flags

**Golden tests.** `crates/rc-formats/tests/formats/golden.rs` compares what the Rust loaders produce for all 19
levels with `crates/rc-formats/data/loader_snapshots.tsv` (per test, level and section: item count, byte count,
SHA-1). The table was generated while the output was byte-identical to the C++ reference extractor, retired on
2026-09-27 (`docs/plan/decisions.md`). After an intended loader change, `RC_SNAPSHOT_WRITE=1 cargo xtask test-job
--test formats --filter golden::` rewrites the rows of the tests that ran.

**One Bevy build.** The `cargo xtask test-*` commands pass `--workspace --features rc-engine/dev`, which enables
Bevy's `dynamic_linking` like `cargo dev`, so the tests reuse the one Bevy build `cargo dev` made
(plain `cargo test --workspace` would compile a second, static Bevy). `cargo check-all` and `cargo clippy-all`
(aliases in `.cargo/config.toml`) add `--all-targets` with the same features; they share one Bevy check build
(metadata only, which a test build cannot reuse). Release builds and `tools/package` stay static (never
`--features dev`).
