//! Planet travel: the player's ship (class 531 / 532 / 533), game mode 6 (take-off, landing, fly-away, the flight
//! between planets), `DoSpaceTransition` (the story cards and the transition movies) and the hand-over to the next
//! level. Spec: docs/plan/progression.md `## travel`, docs/plan/cutscenes_transitions.md §4, docs/plan/menus.md §5.
//! Addresses are level01.elf; every function here has a code-identical copy on all 19 overlays (masked overlay-diff,
//! 2026-10-01: `ShipUpdate` 0x2a1c40, `GameStateUpdate` 0x2a4080, `ShipTravelTo` 0x2a2848, `ShipLandingStart`
//! 0x2a29c0, `DoSpaceTransition` 0x2a68f8 found on 00..18) and the tables they read (the hatch 0x1bdd00, the riders
//! 0x1be200 / 0x1be230, the trail points 0x1bdf30, the flight's shell directions 0x1be060) are byte-identical on
//! every level: one port, the constants below.
//!
//! **What is a system here.** The game has one leave-the-level path: a caller sets the destination 0x15f5c0 and
//! 0x15f570 = 1, the level's main loop (`entry` 0x259c40) ends and the boot runs `DoSpaceTransition` 0x2a68f8, which
//! plays the story cards / movies its rules pick, loads the destination behind the flight or a card, and starts the
//! new overlay's `entry` (level init, the landing). The callers: the fly-away's end ([`space`] sub 3), the story
//! trips `0x2a29a0(p)` (Veldin's Clank 834, class 436, the memory-card resets of `UpdateModeFreeze`), Quit Game
//! (destination −1: the title), New Game / Load (the boot path). In the port that is [`transition::plan`] (the
//! pure rules) driven by the engine's one runtime level change (`rc-engine` `level_switch`). The death reload is
//! **not** a level change (`LoadLevelCoreData(0, 1)` inside the same `entry` loop; G-CLS-030).
//!
//! | module | game | here |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | [`ship`] | `ShipUpdate` 0x2a1c40, the adoption init 0x2a2360, `0x2a2450` / `0x2a2480`, the draw callbacks 0x2a2130 (shadow), 0x2a2ab8 (flames), 0x2a2d28 (trail), the exhaust `fun_0022f5b0` | the class port and its quads |
//! | [`space`] | `EnterShipMode` 0x2a24b8, `ShipTakeOff` 0x2a27c8, `ShipTravelTo` 0x2a2848, `0x2a29a0`, `ShipLandingStart` 0x2a29c0, `GameStateUpdate` 0x2a4080 (subs 0 / 8 / 3), `SpaceLoadingLoop` 0x2a33b0 (sub 4), `EnterSpaceLoadingLoop` 0x2a5868 | the mode-6 state machine |
//! | [`transition`] | `DoSpaceTransition` 0x2a68f8 | the step list (fades, cards, movies, flight, the saved-game writes) |
//! | [`cards`] | `PlayStoryTransition` 0x2a64e0 (boot `fun_00231bd8`), `fun_00231878`, `fun_002316e8` | the story title cards (`space_plates`) |
//! | [`title`] | the boot's title world: `fun_001eb0a8` 0x1eb0a8 (its scene), `transition_update_movie_camera` 0x1eaf88, the scene sounds of 0x1eb798 | the space-scene loop behind the title (G-SAV-012) |
//!
//! The ship globals live in the boot block 0x13e030.. ([`ShipGlobals`]); the moby loop's ship update and mode 6 share
//! them through `Services::travel`.
