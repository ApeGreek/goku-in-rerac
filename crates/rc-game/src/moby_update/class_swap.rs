//! The run-time class swap of a moby (G-CLS-031): class code that turns its own moby into another class while it
//! runs. **Not an engine function**: the game has no `SetMobyClass`; the class code writes the fields inline, the
//! class-dependent part of `InitMobyInstance` (level01 0x263488) over a live moby. Ported once here as a moby
//! service ([`swap`]) so a class that swaps only calls it, and every level copy of such a class registers its classes
//! in [`PORTS`] (the renderer reads [`targets`] to load the models a placed moby may take).
//!
//! **Every caller on the disc** (a scan of the 19 overlays for `sh _, 0xa6(_)` next to `sb _, 0x22(_)`, and for the
//! callers of `update_moby_animation_state` (L01 0x263718, `rc-trace overlay-diff`: the same code on every level)):
//! the engine's 18 callers per level (the sequence changes, `InitMobyInstance`), the crate update's branch toward
//! class 0x1fe (L01 `CrateUpdate` 0x2ea4c8..0x2ea580 and its copy on every level: code no level reaches, classes
//! 503 / 504 / 506–510 are in no class table; `classes::crate_`, G-CLS-009), and level04 0x2c6858 (Eudora's crank
//! followers 432 ↔ 1052, `units::eudora_crank_follower`), two swaps (0x2c690c, 0x2c6a84). No other overlay writes a
//! moby's +0xa6 outside `InitMobyInstance` (the other `sh 0xa6` stores of L01 `ElevatorUpdate` / L07 0x2fb830 are into
//! pvar records).
//!
//! The swap of level04 0x2c690c (the same at 0x2c6a84), what it writes and what the port does:
//!
//! | address | what | port |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | 0x2c690c | +0xa6 o_class = the new class | [`swap`] (`Moby::o_class`; the port's lookups by class follow it: the animation class, the sound table `PlayClassSound` reads, the collision blob, the joint lists, the reaction table) |
//! | 0x2c691c | +0x22 class slot = `0x198040[class]` (level04: 0x197d40) | [`swap`] (`ClassInfo::slot`; the run list's slot order follows it, `scheduler::build_active_list`) |
//! | 0x2c6938 | +0x71 = 0xff (the sequence-sphere cache key: the next matrix build reloads the sphere) | [`swap`] |
//! | 0x2c693c | +0x24 header = `0x197780[slot]` (level04: 0x197480) | [`swap`] (`Moby::has_class`) |
//! | 0x2c6948 | +0x2c scale = class +0x24 (the class scale alone: the instance scale is dropped) | [`swap`] |
//! | 0x2c6944 | `update_moby_animation_state` (L04 0x2415b0 = L01 0x263718): +0x68 / +0x6c key pointers (the port evaluates by class: n/a), +0x7e = trigger count and +0x7c = loop sound of sequence A (+0x52) of the new class; A = 0xff (a snapshot): +0x7c = 0xff, +0x7e = 0; +0x7d (the loop voice) is not touched | [`update_anim_state`] |
//! | 0x2c6958 | +0x72 = class +0x0e | [`swap`] |
//! | 0x2c6964 | +0x94 collision = class +0x10 | [`swap`] (`Moby::has_collision`) |
//! | 0x2c6960 | `MobyAnimSphereLerp` (L04 0x243cd0 = L01 0x265d78): the bounding sphere from the new class's sequences, the change counter, the grid | [`swap`] (`creature::react::sphere_lerp`) |
//! | — | not written: +0x74 update (the moby keeps running the code that swapped it), the pvars, the state, mode (the glow bit 0x10, 0x400), +0x90 glow colour, +0x73 shine, +0x7f, the animation keys and speed | n/a (left as they are) |
//!
//! The draw: the port's renderer draws a placed moby with the model of its live class (`rc-engine` `moby_render`:
//! the models of [`targets`] are loaded with the level and the instance switches to the live class's entities and
//! palette); a created moby (a dynamic slot) is always drawn by its live class.
//!
//! The crate's branch (unreached) writes only +0xa6, +0x22, +0x24, `update_moby_animation_state`, +0x72 and state 2: a
//! subset of the above (n/a, no level reaches it). Inferred [L]: a class the level does not load, or a slot without a
//! class header, has no counterpart on the disc (the game would read through a null header); the port then changes
//! only +0xa6 / +0x22 / +0x24.
