//! The animation-driven sounds of every moby: the sequence sound triggers and the sequence loop sound, played by the
//! engine's one `MobyAnimAdvance` (level01 0x265260) for every class on every level. The class code does not play
//! these: the data does (each sequence header's loop sound +0x11 and its trigger words; docs/plan/audio.md
//! "Sound paths"). Novalis examples: the troopers' jetpack loop (459 seq 8), their reload / hit / step triggers,
//! the Blarg flyers' and the gunship's engine loops (660 / 688 seq 0), the amoeboids' loop, the critters' steps.
//!
//! * **Trigger** ([`rc_formats::moby_anim::advance_trigger`]): the first trigger word whose time the key time passed
//!   this tick plays `PlayClassSound(sound, 0, moby)`; the advance then returns (no loop refresh that tick).
//! * **Loop sound** (`FUN_002637d8`, called from the advance's tail): moby +0x7c = class sound of the sequence's loop
//!   (0xff none), +0x7d = its voice slot (0xff none). A moby with neither skips it; a moby without a slot is only
//!   refreshed on its phase, `(moby address >> 8 & 3) == (0x15f5cc & 3)`, i.e. every 4th tick (the moby array is at
//!   0x1e9a480 on Novalis, so the phase is `index & 3`). The refresh plays the loop with flags 4 when there is no
//!   slot (a refused play — out of range, no free slot — leaves 0xff: retried on the next phase tick); with a slot it
//!   drops the slot when another owner took it (the voice was freed: its owner +0x18 is zeroed) and releases it when
//!   the slot plays another class sound of this moby (the sequence changed its loop).
//! * A tick whose advance landed a blend's transition does neither (the game sets its +0x7c word to 0xffff for the
//!   rest of the call). A zero rate or speed still refreshes the loop (the flyers' one-frame sequence 0 has speed 0).
//! * Sequence changes set +0x7c: [`after_sequence_change`] (the blend and the hard cut); [`init`] is the part of
//!   `InitMobyInstance` 0x263488 that does (`update_moby_animation_state` on sequence 0).
//!
//! The draws (a play's pitch bend, `SoundSlotAlloc` 0x2a13a0) land in the moby loop at the moby's advance, before its
//! update, as in the game.
