//! Gold-weapon offers, classes 304 (the offer) and 1456–1465 (the props that go with each gold weapon):
//! `ItemOfferUpdate` level01 0x2e1ac0. Spec: `docs/plan/moby_update_catalogue.md` "In the port: teleporter pads and
//! item offers"; the buy prompt is the shared NPC talk system (`docs/plan/interaction.md` §3,
//! [`crate::moby_update::interact`]).
//!
//! The pvar block starts with the talk block (`interact::talk`); pvar+0x40 (s32) is the offer's index k into the
//! gold-weapon table 0x1deb10 (level01 `.data`: `[19, 10, 11, 16, 17, 15, 21, 20, 25, 9]`, item ids); the gold
//! weapon is owned when `0x13e520[item]` ≠ 0. On Novalis the offers are talk slots 3..12 (instance +0x74), whose
//! node lists read "You must own the Tesla Claw …" (condition kind 2: the plain weapon owned), "You need 60,000
//! bolts and 4 Gold Bolts …" (kind 6 false) and "△ Buy the Gold Tesla Claw for 60,000 bolts and 4 Gold Bolts"
//! (kind 6 true; the price is printed from the record's +0x14).
//!
//! Per tick:
//! * **the challenge gate**: k ≠ −1, k even and the times-completed count `0x15ee20` = 0 → `DeleteMoby`, return
//!   (on a first playthrough the even offers and their props are gone after the load pass);
//! * state 0: class 304: gold weapon not owned and `NpcTalkRegister` ≠ −1 → state 1, else state 3. The props
//!   (1456–1465) → state 2;
//! * state 1: talk radius +0x0c = 1.9, `NpcTalkUpdate`; when the node advanced last (+0x04) is 2 (the buy node, which
//!   has no scene): the gold weapon owned, bolts −= its gold price (`0x1c4544 + 0x18·item`), `FUN_002aea70(offer)`
//!   (the upgrade effect, not ported: [`Handoff::GoldUpgrade`]), state 4;
//! * state 2: the prop is deleted once its gold weapon is owned;
//! * state 4: outside game mode 0 wait; else `memcard_Save(0, −1)` (not ported: counted) and state 3.
