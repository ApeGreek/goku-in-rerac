//! The game's per-frame draw-callback lists: `RegisterDrawCallback` 0x21afe0 (list 1, drained by 0x21b030 after
//! the mobys and before the particles) and `RegisterDrawCallback2` 0x21b198 (list 2, drained by 0x21b1e8 after the
//! particles). A moby update registers `(fn, moby)` during the tick; the frame render calls them in registration
//! order; `0x2ab920` clears both lists at the start of the next tick. docs/plan/world_animation.md §0, §3.
//!
//! Most callbacks only draw (the water strips and ripples of `rc-engine`'s water renderer). Some also change game
//! state in the draw, with `rand` draws on the one shared stream: the fire / smoke fields 760 (`0x2fe080`:
//! flame timers, respawns). The port keeps the registrations here ([`DrawCallbacks`], in `Services`) and runs the state
//! part of every registered callback in [`run_frame`] at the start of the next tick's moby loop
//! (`Scheduler::tick`): on the PS2 that is the end of the frame render, and nothing between it and the moby loop
//! draws from the stream (the pad read and the free-slot pass do not), so the draws land at the game's place.
//! The renderer draws the current tick's registrations with the state as the last [`run_frame`] left it (one frame
//! behind the PS2's draw-time update: the fade and the scroll lag by one step, invisible at 60 fps).
//!
//! Frame pacing: the PS2 drains the lists once per rendered frame, so on a lag frame with a catch-up tick (two
//! ticks, one frame) it runs the last tick's callbacks once. The port runs them once per tick, which keeps the
//! effect's speed independent of the frame rate (identical in the deterministic one-tick-per-frame mode).
