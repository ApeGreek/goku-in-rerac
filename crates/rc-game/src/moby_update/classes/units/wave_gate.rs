//! U426 (census 2026-09-29): class 1271, a wave gate of Gemlik (level13 `0x30af50`, one instance). Not an enemy: a
//! watcher over up to eight moby groups. While any of them has a live member it does nothing; once all are gone (and
//! Ratchet is inside its cuboid, when it has one) it sets its own state and its command byte +0xbc to the values in
//! its pvars, which the level's other code reads (the doors / the next wave the gate opens: their classes' own
//! business). No sound, no effect, no hit.
//!
//! **Pvars** (s32): +0x00..+0x1c the groups (−1 unused), +0x20 the state to take (−1 none), +0x24 the command byte
//! (−1 none), +0x28 the cuboid (−1 none).
//!
//! ## Coverage (level13 `0x30af50` and `0x30ae68`)
//!
//! | address | what it does | ported / not |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | the groups up to the first −1 (the loop's pointer does not advance past a −1, so it re-reads it for the remaining of the eight): `0x30ae68(group, −1)` ≠ 0 → nothing this tick | a group still alive | [`update`] ([`alive`]) |
//! | `0x30ae68(group, s)`: the members of the group list (`0x1abb40[group]`) in a live state (≥ 0), not held by the Suck Cannon (no suck record, `0x2fe8d0` = `0x304100`, or its state < 4) and, unless `s` = −1, not in state `s` | the count | [`alive`] (`react::rec_state`) |
//! | the ship-combat word 0x140940 ≠ 0 and Ratchet in state 0x32 → nothing | Ratchet's ship mode (G-HERO-002 / G-LVL-009): never in the port, the port takes the other branch | [`update`] (no ship-mode word in the port) |
//! | cuboid +0x28 ≠ −1 and Ratchet (0x13f3d0) outside it (`0x26b9a8` = `PointInCuboid`) → nothing | | [`update`] (`World::in_cuboid`) |
//! | +0x20 ≠ −1 → state; +0x24 ≠ −1 → +0xbc | the gate opens | [`update`] |
//!
//! Native; no rand, no float work beyond the cuboid test.
