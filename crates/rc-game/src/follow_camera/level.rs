//! **The level camera system**: the level's camera records (`0x15ef50`, [`rc_formats::cameras`]) as the 48 UpdateCam
//! slots, the per-tick choice of the active camera (`UpdateAllCameras` 0x20d620 with `Camera_ActivationCheckPriority`
//! 0x20d410), and the class-17 regions that retune the follow camera (activation `0x319688` → `0x318de0`, region test
//! `0x318c40`). Spec: docs/plan/player_controller.md §15.
//!
//! **Slots** (`FUN_0020ef58`, level start): one UpdateCam (0x1675d0 + i·0xa0, active flag 0x169d10[i]) per record, in
//! record order: +0x84 the record index, +0x86 the class, +0x8c its mode (the class's row of the level's
//! `lvl.camvtbl`), +0x7c the priority (pvar +0x1c), +0x74 the activation kind (pvar +0x1f), +0x78 = −1, +0x7d / +0x7e /
//! +0x8e = 0; the record's pvar +0x04 = the slot. Then `CameraResetBehindHero` 0x20ee80 makes the class-0 slot (the
//! follow camera) current.
//!
//! **The choice** (0x20d620): the current camera's pre hook, then for every active slot but the current one in slot
//! order `Camera_ActivationCheckPriority(slot, best)`; a true answer makes that slot the best (later slots are compared
//! with it). The check ([`activation_check`]): priority 0 never; the class's activation hook first (−1 no, 1 yes, 0 go
//! on); then by the kind: 0 always, 1 / 2 once entered (+0x7d), 4 Ratchet's feet in the cuboid (pvar +0x0c), 7 the
//! hero's camera mode 0x1415d4 equal to the class (class 3 with a rail in pvar +0x24: on that rail, not off its end),
//! any other kind never; and a candidate beats the best only with a **higher** priority, unless the best is releasing
//! (+0x7e ≠ 0). A new best is switched in (`FUN_0020d110`: its blend kind, pvar +0x1d; the port's switches are the
//! first-person, script and type-6 cameras' own, `super`), then its update runs.
//!
//! **What the port runs** ([`CameraPorts`]): class 0 (the follow camera, `super::Camera::update_type0`), 4 (first
//! person), 5 (script) and 6 (the Visibomb's view) — their switches are the existing ones — 7 (the Swingshot camera,
//! [`super::swing`]: switched in and out here), the level-class cameras 3 (the rail / slide camera, [`super::rail`]),
//! 1 (the fixed view) and 14 (the side view, [`super::cuboid`]) through [`super::class_cam`] (the switch's blends
//! `0x20d110`, the shared D block), and the hooks of the never-current classes 17 (below), 23 (the placed view,
//! `placed_*`) and 18 (the moby focus, [`super::focus`]), each on the levels whose code for it is the reference level's.
//! The loop checks every slot but the current camera's own (two class-3 records hand over at a rail change). A choice
//! of any other class (8: the hoverboard, G-HERO-008; 19: the armed fly-bys, no ported arming class; 20 / 21: the
//! level-14 grind race, G-LVL-007; 22: giant Clank, G-HERO-005) is recorded in [`LevelCameras::wanted`] and the
//! current camera stays (G-HERO-027).
//!
//! **Class 17** ([`RegionTweak`]): its hook always answers "no" (it never becomes the camera) and, while the follow
//! camera is current, retunes it through the follow camera's setters (`0x313560`..`0x313b48`, [`super::Camera`]):
//! * Hook `0x319688`: nothing after a "once" region was left (+0x48 = 1, +0x4a ≠ 0); mode 11 only with body 2
//!   (0x1413f4); modes 1 / 10 do not start (+0x2e = 0) while Ratchet is off the ground (0x13f65c ≠ 0) unless on level
//!   14 hanging from a ledge (0x1415d4 = 0xd); mode 2 outside group 0x1a (the cable) only zeroes the counter (the
//!   owner lock stays); else `0x318de0`.
//! * `0x318de0`: mode 8 only while the camera data's +0x230 ≠ 0, mode 6 only while it is 0. Out of the region
//!   (`0x318c40`) → leave (the counter → 0, +0x4a = 1 if it was running, the owner lock released `0x313560`). The lock
//!   (`0x313598`, the camera data's +0x220): free, already this region's, or held by a lower priority → taken; else
//!   the counter → 0 (+0x4a) without a release. Leave when +0x36 is set and the camera yaw 0x167258 is 80° or more off
//!   the record's `rot.z`, or (+0x48, mode 5) L1 / L2 is held (0x13cae0 & 5). On the first tick (+0x2e = 0) the
//!   follow camera's horizontal spring is captured (+0x40 / +0x44); mode 5's first tick places the follow camera at the
//!   region's distance, pivot and look heights at once (the pvar's turn +0x00 zeroed). Then +0x2e += 1; mode 10 → the
//!   stick off (`0x313858`) and +0x230 = 0x14d (the ledge turn of `0x3111d8` then stays off); mode 11 → the stick off,
//!   +0x230 = 2; modes 2 / 4 → the stick off (+0x1b8 |= 3), the counter held at 200, the run-toward lock (`0x3137f8`);
//!   modes 1 / 7 / 9 / 10 → the stick moving sets the counter to 200, at 200 the turn stops (held there while Ratchet
//!   moves), at 400 it starts again from 1; mode 3 → the counter held at 1; others → held at 200. The turn (not while
//!   stopped in modes 1 / 7 / 9): `0x313af0(turn·(counter / 200), tolerance, (cos rot.z, sin rot.z, 0))` (mode 3:
//!   `/ 1`). Distance (+0x24) → `0x313628` at 0.003 and the run-toward lock (modes 6 / 8: 0.002 and the pull-back
//!   maximum `0x313668(d + 1.36)`); pivot height (+0x28) → `0x313690` (0.003 / 0.002); look height (+0x30) →
//!   `0x3136c8` (0.005 / 0.002); pitch (+0x50, degrees) → `0x313718`; +0x54 / +0x56 → +0x1b8 |= 2 / 1; +0x34 = 0 →
//!   the leash off; the spring (+0x38, +0x3c) eased from the captured one over 120 ticks (`0x313768`); modes 1 / 7 /
//!   10 → `0x3137f8`, `0x313820`, the vertical spring 0.01 / 0.2 (`0x3137b0`).
//! * Region test `0x318c40`: false unless the follow camera is current; cuboid +0x0c, cuboid +0x4c, cylinder +0x10,
//!   sphere +0x08 (Ratchet's feet 0x13f3d0), then the path polygon +0x14; any present shape counts as inside
//!   without a test while the region is running (+0x2e > 0) in mode 2 with Ratchet in group 0x1a, or in mode 4 with
//!   the camera mode 0x1415d4 = 3 (the cable's, the rails').
//!
//! Native `f32` for the region's arithmetic; the values go into the PS2-float follow camera through [`Pf::f`].
