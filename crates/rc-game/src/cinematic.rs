//! The in-level cinematic layer: the calls the moby classes make into the camera, the hero and the scene / movie
//! players while they stage a cutaway (docs/plan/cutscenes.md §3–§5). The game has **no script system** for these:
//! each class calls the same few engine functions directly from its update:
//!
//! | game function | here | effect |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `CameraScript(pos, euler, mode, ticks, collide)` 0x316ef8 | [`camera_script`] | the script camera (type 5) switched in ([`crate::follow_camera::script`]) |
//! | `0x316dd0` / `0x316e28` | [`camera_targets`] | its target position / Euler |
//! | `0x316e88(a, b)` | [`camera_curve`] | mode 3's distance curve |
//! | level02 `0x2f8a18(mode, ticks)` | [`script_mode`] | the script camera's mode and timer (the launch tube's ride) |
//! | `CameraScript2(kind)` 0x317070 | [`camera_script2`] | back to the follow camera (cut or blend) |
//! | `0x15f404 = 1 / 0` | [`letterbox`] | the letterbox bars (`DrawScreenFade` 0x21b7d8) and the HUD hidden (`HudDraw` 0x24fb50); the creature layer's `Globals::cutscene` *is* this global |
//! | `SetState(s, play)` 0x23cf98 | [`hero_state`] | Ratchet's state (0x72: held, no control) |
//! | `HeroTeleport(pos, euler, state, reset_cam)` 0x2368e0 | [`hero_teleport`] | Ratchet placed, motion cleared, state set |
//! | `DialogStreamStart(k)` 0x2ac330 | [`start_scene`] | a mode-2 scene (the engine's scene player) |
//! | `DialogStreamUpdate(n)` 0x2acf50 | [`start_movie`] | an in-level PSS movie (`StartPssMovie` 0x2ad0c0, mode 1) |
//! | `FadeToBlack(n)` 0x21b438 | [`fade_to_black`] | n blocking black-quad frames over the last image |
//! | `ShowBanner(msg, t)` 0x2789e0 / `ShowPlanetBanner(p)` 0x277c38 | [`show_banner`] / [`show_planet_banner`] | the HUD banner ([`Cinematic::banner`]) |
//! | `UnlockPlanet(p)` 0x2756d0 | [`unlock_planet`] | the saved game's planet bits and map order (+ banner) |
//! | `memcard_Save(0, −1)` | [`save`] | the engine's `memcard_Save` on the native card (`rc-engine` `saves`) |
//! | `EnterSlideshowMode` 0x2ad558 / `PlayMovieB(n)` 0x2ad050 / `EnterMenuMode(kind)` 0x28bf50 | [`enter_slideshow`] / [`play_movie_b`] / [`enter_menu_mode`] | the credits (mode 7), a transitions-table movie (mode 1), the page menu (mode 3) |
//! | `0x2a29a0(dest)` | [`leave_level`] | leave the level for `dest` (`DoSpaceTransition`, `crate::travel`) |
//! | `SetMissionDone(m)` 0x265080 | [`set_mission_done`] | the level's mission byte done (the live bytes and the saved game) |
//! | `0x317d88` / `0x317aa0` / `0x317e70` | [`camera_type6`] | the type-6 camera's switch / tracking / hand-back (the Visibomb) |
//! | `0x313628` / `0x313690` | [`follow_distance`] / [`follow_pivot_height`] | the follow camera's distance / pivot-height targets set by a class (the Pokitaru boats) |
//! | `0x313af0` / `0x3136c8` | [`follow_turn_toward`] / [`follow_look_height`] | the follow camera turned toward a direction / its look height (the collapsing platform 701's look, `0x2f9000`) |
//! | `0x16735c = moby` | [`focus_moby`] | the follow camera's scripted focus moby (its auto-yaw, `0x3111d8`) |
//! | a class-18 record's +0x34 / +0x38, level18 `0x306338` | [`focus_record`] / [`focus_suppress`] | the moby focus record's distance / pivot height (the boss 1422's tweak) and its leave word +0x50 |
//! | `0x15f3fc = f` (gameplay) | [`set_fade`] | the full-screen fade to black a class writes in game mode 0 (`DrawWorld` 0x21a1b8 draws black at `min(f, 1)·128` at the end of the frame; the cutaway machine 1157, the boss 1422) |
//!
//! The camera calls are queued here and applied by the tick right after the moby loop ([`Cinematic::calls`],
//! `crate::tick`); the hero calls go through the hero-block channel ([`crate::moby_update::services::HeroFields`]);
//! the scene / movie / game-state requests are for the engine ([`Cinematic::requests`]). The creature layer's
//! `ScriptRequest`s (gunship 688) are turned into the same calls ([`from_creature`]).
