//! **Hero polish — the hero's effects on the rest of the game**: the requests the hero code makes of systems it does
//! not own (the camera, the particle system, the sound layer's delayed voices), queued during the hero update in the
//! game's order and handed over by the tick (`crate::tick`) or the particle hook. One mechanism for every hero state:
//! a state asks through the helpers here and never talks to the camera or the particle pool itself.
//!
//! * **Camera shake** ([`HeroFx::shakes`], [`shake`]): the hero code's stores into the camera's shake records
//!   0x167260 / 0x167270 (`crate::follow_camera::Shake`), e.g. the Thruster stomp's landing (0.2 along up for 40
//!   ticks, level01 0x2390a0). The tick hands them to `Camera::request_shake` right after the hero update; the
//!   camera update of the same tick applies them, as in the game.
//! * **Particles** ([`HeroFx::parts`], [`spark`], [`dust`], [`bubbles`], [`sparkle_burst`]): the hero code calls the particle
//!   spawners inside its update, and the spawners' random draws land there. The port makes those draws at the
//!   game's point (so the one `rand` stream stays in step) and queues the spawn with them; the particle hook creates
//!   the queued records, in order, right before `UpdateParts` ([`create_particles`]). Nothing else creates a
//!   particle between the hero update and `UpdateParts` (the hand items' wall / ground sparks are not ported), so the
//!   pool slots and the update order are the game's. One difference: the game makes a spawner's own draws only when
//!   `CreatePart` found a free record; the port always makes them (the pool never fills in play: 2048 records).
//! * **Delayed voices** ([`HeroFx::voices`], `0x236810` / `0x236860`): the 8-entry queue at 0x141528 (`{active,
//!   sound, timer, flags}`); SetState queues the surfacing gasps (7 / 8) there, and right after the transitions
//!   (mode 0) `0x236860` counts every entry's timer down and plays `0x236738(sound, flags)` when it runs out
//!   ([`flush`]). The swim code's own voices (`SwimEvent::Sound` / `Voice`, which it records instead of playing)
//!   go through the same flush, at the same point.
//! * **Footsteps** (`HeroFootstepSound` 0x227e48 → `PlayFootstepSound` 0x2a1898, [`HeroSounds::footstep`]): the level def
//!   `tbl[level] + class·4 + foot·2 + variant + 2` (docs/plan/audio.md "Sound paths"), class = the footstep class of the
//!   ground under the feet 0x14063d (collision type bits 5–6, set by the ground probe), variant 1 with the Magneboots
//!   worn. Walking and running play them at fixed key times of sequences 3 / 4 ([`walk_footsteps`], `FUN_00227e90`,
//!   after the hand item's update); the landing of the fall (0x242930 case 6 / 0x2d, on the ground) plays both feet
//!   ([`HeroFx::footsteps`], queued in the transitions and played by [`flush`]).
