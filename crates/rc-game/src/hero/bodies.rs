//! **The other hero bodies (G-HERO-005).** The game's hero is a body that can change: the body word `0x1413f4` (0
//! Ratchet, 1 Clank, 2 Giant Clank, 3 the Hologuise disguise) picks which moby the hero code drives (`0x1413d0`: Ratchet's
//! own moby `0x13fdd8`, or the body moby `0x13fdd4`), which states it runs (Clank 0x43..0x52 / 0x7d, Giant Clank
//! 0x5a..0x62, the disguise 0x53..0x59), the capsule, the probes' heights, the HUD and the classes' branches. This module
//! is that system, ported once for every level and class that uses it:
//!
//! * **The switch** `SwitchCharacter(mode, state, moby)` ([`switch_character`]; level01 `0x231348` = levels 02, 03, 05,
//!   06, 08, 11, 12, 14, 16, 17; level00 `0x210a08` = 04 `0x203fe8`, 07 `0x238870`, 09 `0x2306e8`, 10 `0x204070`, 13
//!   `0x21c4f0`, 15 `0x208b80`, 18 `0x218800`, which add Giant Clank's energy 200): the superset, as every copy runs on
//!   the paths a level reaches (a level-01-family copy never switches to body 2).
//! * **Leaving the body** ([`leave_body`]; level01 `0x231450`, level00 `0x210b30` = 04 `0x204110`, 07 `0x238998`, 09
//!   `0x230810`, 10 `0x204198`, 13 `0x21c618`; 06 `0x227cf8` / 17 `0x20da68` without the body-2 branch; 15 `0x208ca8`
//!   / 18 `0x218928` without the body-1 branch): the superset (a copy's missing branch is for a body that level never
//!   has).
//! * **The per-body idle** `0x227638` ([`body_idle`]; L04 `0x21ac18`, L06 `0x239528`, L07 `0x24f4a0`, L09
//!   `0x247318`, L10 `0x21aca0`, L13 `0x233120`, L15 `0x21ab60`, L17 `0x223380`, L18 `0x22c418`): what `SetState(0)`
//!   becomes in a body.
//! * **The body's hero update** `HeroUpdateAlt` (L00 `0x2062b0`; level01 `0x228000`): [`body_update`] (the hero part) and
//!   [`after_update`] (the mobys it creates and places: Clank's antenna glow 0x4b4 and rotor 0x47a, Giant Clank's pilot).
//! * The states: [`clank`] (body 1), [`giant`] (body 2), [`disguise`] (body 3, 0x53..0x59: the Hologuise's, with the item
//!   and the way in / out in `crate::hero::hologuise`, 2026-10-01 G-WPN-006).
//!
//! **Plug-and-play.** A class that hands the hero a body calls [`queue_switch`] (`SwitchCharacter`) and
//! [`queue_leave`] (the level's leave copy) through its `World`; the per-body idle is `HeroCall::BodyIdle`. A class
//! that branches on the body reads `World::hero.mode` (0x1413f4) and, for Clank's kick, `World::hero.state == 0x51`.
//! The engine binds the hero's animation to the body moby through [`crate::hero::anim::HeroAnimCtl`] (the tick calls
//! `AnimCtl::bind_body`), draws the body moby from the table, and gives the hero the body classes' joint lists
//! ([`BodyJoints`], `fx::JointData::bodies`).
//!
//! **Coverage** (`address | what | ported (fn) / NOT ported (gap) / n/a (why)`):
//!
//! | address | what | status |
//! |---|---|---|
