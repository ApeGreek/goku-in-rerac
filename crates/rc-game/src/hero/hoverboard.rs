//! **The Hoverboard: hero states 0x6b..0x6f and the race the board keeps** (movement group 0x16; levels 5 and 16, the
//! same source compiled into both overlays: level05's copy carries level 16's branches too). Read from the level05
//! decomp and disassembly: SetState `0x24cee8`, the physics `0x244a70`, the transitions `0x255960` and the board's
//! helpers. docs/plan/hero_states.md "Hoverboard".
//!
//! **Mounting.** The board is class 439 (level05 `0x2f87a8`, `crate::moby_update::classes::units::hoverboard`):
//! Ratchet within 5.5 of it, outside groups 0x15 / 0x16 → the board moby is stored in 0x13fbbc and `SetState(0x6b, 1)`.
//! Its pvars name the race: +0x20 the race line (a path), +0x24 the respawn path, +0x28 the race host (Rilgar's race girl
//! 918), +0x2c.. the racers (+0x40 of them), +0x44 / +0x48 / +0x4c the moby groups of the boost hoops 1139, the boost
//! pads 1140 and the weapon pickups 470 (level 16).
//!
//! **States.** 0x6b riding, 0x6c the ramp jump, 0x6d the crash (thrown off), 0x6e into the water, 0x6f into a wall. The
//! crash states end with `HeroTeleport` to the respawn path's point behind Ratchet in state 0x6b.
//!
//! **What the board reads and writes outside the hero block** goes through [`BoardWorld`] (the snapshot the tick
//! builds before the hero update: the board's pvars, its paths, the racers, the pickups' groups and the game-state
//! words the race tests) and [`BoardCmd`] (the stores into other mobys and the game state, applied at the start of
//! the next moby loop, before any class reads them: `crate::moby_update::classes::units::hoverboard::apply`). The
//! board's carry under Ratchet (`0x24bdc0`'s tail) is applied by the tick right after the hero update.
