//! **Weapons: the throw gloves and the Bomb Glove** (level01; docs/plan/hero_states.md "Weapons + first person").
//!
//! * **The weapon check's throw case** (`HeroPdaGadget` 0x240ed8, items 10 / 0x11 / 0x14 / 0x18 / 0x19: the Bomb
//!   Glove, Mine Glove, Glove of Doom, Drone Device, Decoy Glove; [`fire`], the row's `fire` in
//!   `super::gadgets::HAND_ITEMS`): ○ within 7 ticks (at most the ticks the item has been ready), or ○ held while the
//!   item became ready 9..16 ticks ago, in the standing / walking / crouching / gliding / grinding groups (not with the
//!   weapon already out 0x1413f8, not in 0x1e, 0x23 only past frame 25): with ammo (`0x249530`) → the throw state
//!   **0x23** when crouched, standing, stopping or walking slowly (stick < 0.7), else the weapon arm while moving
//!   (`0x22ee08`, [`draw_weapon`]); without ammo the glove's class sound 0 (the empty click).
//! * **State 0x23 "glove throw"** (group 6; entry [`throw_entry`] after `super::melee`'s group-6 entry:
//!   `SetAnim(9, 0x2c, 7)`; physics [`physics`]: aim at the stick (`0x2351d0(11, 50°, −1)`) or turn to the aim at
//!   15 rad/s, `SpeedStep(30, 35)·dt²`, gravity 54 (25 in the air, with the steep-wall stop); transitions
//!   [`transitions`]: ✕ within 11 ticks after key time 19 jumps (crouched: the crouch jumps), idle from 21).
//! * **The weapon arm** (0x1413f8, `0x22ee08`, [`draw_weapon`]): out for the moving throw; its timer 0x13f50c counts
//!   in the post-move (`super::physics`). The arm is a **pose layer** on Ratchet's moby ([`super::anim::AnimLayer`],
//!   `FUN_00263e08` on his joint list 12 (gp−0x7560; a second one on list 13 when 0x1413fb = 2), kept in 0x140058 /
//!   0x14005c: [`Weapons::layers`]): it plays the item's upper-body sequence (`def +0x28`, `+0x2c` crouched) from
//!   Ratchet's current key over `ticks(10)` (item +0x18 ≠ 0) or `ticks(11)` at full weight (`FUN_002641c0`), while
//!   the main animation (the run, the walk, the jump) keeps playing on the other joints. Upkeep `0x22f068`
//!   ([`arm_upkeep`]): re-blend over 8 ticks when the item's layer sequence changed (crouching), advance
//!   (`FUN_00263f70`), weight → 1 by 0.2 a tick; when the layer sequence wraps with 0x1413fa clear the arm is down
//!   (0x1413f8 = 0) and the layer fades (0x140064 = 1: speed 0, weight → 0 by 0.07 a tick; 0.25 after a holster,
//!   0x140064 = 2) and is freed at 0. The renderer blends it over those joints
//!   (`rc_formats::moby_anim::evaluate_layered`). The holster check `0x2405f8` ([`holster_check`]: stopped within 6
//!   ticks of the draw → put away, `0x140064 = 2`, state 0x23). The Comet-Strike (0x15) is a full-body state: the
//!   wrench's code never calls `0x22ee08`, so it has no layer.
//! * **The gloves' item update** (the Bomb Glove's `0x2d8330` and its three copies): `super::gloves` (one shared
//!   update, a row per glove). The Bomb Glove's row: 3 ticks of warm-up; the hand point in the glove (joint list 0 +
//!   (0, −0.09, −0.02) in its frame); the look stance 1 becomes 0x1e (`SetState(0x1e, 1)`, made right after the slot
//!   loop: [`after_items`]); when the 20-tick fire timer is out: **the throw** — the arm out 17 ticks, ○ in the
//!   first-person stance 0x1e with ammo (the first-person throw: original behaviour), or 0x23 at tick 16 — voice
//!   0x1a, one ammo used (`0x249450`, the ammo-used stat 0x13dea0), the glove's state 3; the aim of the held bomb
//!   every tick (a point 0.86 ahead-left of Ratchet, 0.49 up ([`launch_point`]); 8.5 ahead, or in first person along
//!   the camera, clamped −80°..34°, to where the camera's line hits; `0x2d80f0` ([`launch_velocity`]): 8.5 u/s level,
//!   the vertical speed of the arc with gravity 11 (at most 5.5 u/s), aimed ahead when the target is more than 50°
//!   off Ratchet's facing or closer than 1.5); state 3 releases the bomb (`0x2c27a8`,
//!   `crate::moby_update::classes::bomb::release`) — a new one is created in the glove when there is ammo
//!   (`0x2c2640`, `CreateMoby(0x79)` through the hit sink).
//!
//! **Ammo** ([`Weapons::ammo`]): the game state's table 0x13d428 + id, mirrored like the owned items (the engine
//! copies it in before the tick and back after; `uses_ammo` from the item records, +8).
//!
//! **The aim at a target** (`crate::targeting`): without L1 / L2 held (or with 0x1413fc) the glove's update searches
//! the target list 0x1abe80 ([`crate::targeting::aim_search`] with [`crate::targeting::BOMB_GLOVE`]) and aims the
//! held bomb's arc at the chosen target's aim point (its record's height above it) instead of the point 8.5 ahead;
//! the target is 0x13fda0 ([`Weapons::aim`]), and the throw state 0x23 turns Ratchet to it (SetState 0x23: 0x13fda8 =
//! 1, 0x13fdac = its yaw). The bomb then previews the landing and registers the reticle
//! (`crate::moby_update::classes::bomb`).
//!
//! Not ported: the melee aim-assist `0x22e238` over the same list, the gold gloves (0x13e52a..: 0), the gloves' throw
//! stats records 0x1416d0 / 0x141708 / 0x141720 / 0x141748 (counted in [`Weapons::throws`]), 0x141618.
//!
//! **Weapons that keep the arm raised** (item def +0x30 → 0x1413fa; the Pyrocitor, the Blaster, …): [`gun_stance`]
//! (`0x242858`: the stop 3 (its SetState and its physics) or the walk's slow stop becomes the idle state in the weapon's
//! standing sequence; the walk's SetState does not call it, so Ratchet runs off from the stance while firing),
//! [`arm_on_state_change`] (`0x22eca0`: the arm layers when leaving idle), [`stance_kept`] / [`idle_stance`] (the idle
//! transitions keep the stance), [`put_away`]'s return to the idle sequence (made by [`apply_pending`] where the item
//! update asked for it).
//!
//! **The glove-holding layers** (0x140050 / 0x140054, [`hold_update`] = `0x22e660`; docs/plan/hero_gameplay.md §11):
//! with a hand item whose def +0x18 (0x1413fb) is set, Ratchet's arm(s) replay his current key from the holding
//! classes 1 / 2, so the weapon stays in his hands and level while he runs; the firing arm layer takes over from them.
