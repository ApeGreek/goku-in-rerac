//! **Targeting: the target list, the aim searches, the throw's landing preview and the ground reticle** (level01;
//! docs/plan/hero_gameplay.md §8).
//!
//! **One target list for everything.** `BuildActiveMobyList` 0x265548 builds, with the run list, the null-terminated
//! list `0x1abe80`: every moby of the run list whose mode has 0x1000 ("targetable"), in the run list's order
//! ([`target_list`]). Each target carries a **target record** (`FUN_002711f8`: with mode 0x20 the first word of the
//! pvar block; the creatures' damage record, `crate::moby_update::creature::header`): `+0x00` health, `+0x10` the
//! height of the aim point above the moby's position ([`aim_height`]), `+0x0a` / `+0x38..+0x3a` bytes other
//! searches read (a radius ×0.125, the head look's range, priority and height).
//!
//! **Per-weapon searches over it** (verified from the level01 decompiler output and disassembly): every reader of
//! `0x1abe80` has its own selection code with its own constants — there is no shared "auto-aim" routine:
//!
//! | reader | what it picks | rules |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `0x2d8330` Bomb Glove (class 192, item 10) | the throw's aim point ([`aim_search`], [`BOMB_GLOVE`]) | range 15 (2D, from the launch point), within 45° of the reference yaw or 90° within 4, elevation < 55°, at most 2 above the launch point, a clear world line from the camera (flags 6); greedy: each accepted target becomes the reference (its yaw, its distance) for the rest of the list |
//! | `0x2351d0` → `0x22e238` / `0x22dff0` melee aim assist (wrench swings, the Comet-Strike, the glove throw 0x23 without a glove target) | the swing's facing | range 11, cone 50° (`0x2351d0(11, 50°, −1)`), score `d + diff·d` (+7 for a record flag), health ≠ 0 |
//! | `0x22c080` `HeroScanTargets` | the head-look target | every 7th tick; range = record `+0x38`, 110° cone, 60° pitch, score `d + diff·d` (−1.5 for the current one), record `+0x39` priority, a clear line from the head |
//! | `0x2c7d68` (the Devastator 11, class 157; `crate::hero::devastator::search`) | the missile's aim and lock | creatures (class type 5); within 2.5 a hard lock (60° / 45°), else the cone 10° (+40° gold) narrowed by the record's radius byte `+0x0a` ([`cone_miss`]), a clear camera line; a creature no missile holds becomes the lock |
//! | `0x2ca310` (the Blaster 15, class 168; `crate::hero::blaster::search`) | the shot's aim | range 20 (3D), the cone 9° narrowed by the radius byte ([`cone_miss`]), clear camera and muzzle lines (a blocked one ends the search), the yaw taken within 10° |
//! | `0x2e4bb8` (the R.Y.N.O. 23, class 454; `crate::hero::ryno::search`) | the salvo's targets | creatures with a record and health ≥ 0, drawn (or not yet taken this salvo), within 97° of the camera's yaw and elevation and 80 (the salvo's re-targets: 180°, 100), score `d/5` within 5 else `yaw²·pitch²·d + d`, a clear line (flags 2) |
//! | `0x2cf138` (the Tesla Claw 19, class 177; `crate::hero::tesla::build`) | the beam's target(s) | creatures with a record within 15 (2D) of the claw, 32° of the camera's yaw and 45° of Ratchet's; score `1.5·(32° − off)/32° + (15 − d)/15`, the best two (the second for the gold claw) |
//! | `0x2c5778` (the gold Devastator missile's re-target) | | not ported (gold not mirrored) |
//! | `0x2d2018` (the Morph-o-Ray 21, class 185; `crate::hero::morph_ray::search`) | the beam's target | creatures with a record, not 0x58e / 0x452; within 2.5 (60° of Ratchet, 2 in height) at once, else within 8 in the 10° cone ([`cone_miss`]), the line clear or blocked by the target only |
//! | `0x2bfe40` (the Mine Glove's mine, class 74; `crate::moby_update::classes::mine`) | the mine's seek | armed and landed: any target within 1.5 (3-D) sets it off; else the nearest (xy) non-crate within `4 + radius/8` (×3 lured), less than 2 above or below |
//! | `0x2d49f8`, `0x30d308` | others | their own ranges and cones (not ported) |
//!
//! So the system here is one list and one record reader shared by every weapon, plus a search per weapon: the Bomb
//! Glove's as a data row ([`AimRules`]), the guns' as their own functions (their rules differ in kind, not only in
//! constants), sharing the cone test [`cone_miss`] (the Blaster and the Devastator) and the record readers.
//!
//! **The ground reticle: the bomb's, the mine's and the decoy's.** The bomb (class 121) of the glove (class 0xc0) runs
//! the landing preview `0x2c2be0` every tick from its update `0x2c3300` ([`arc_landing`]): from the launch point (held)
//! or its position (flying), its velocity stepped 10 ticks at a time under gravity 11 u/s² (`p += v; v.z −= 11·dt²`), a
//! line test per step (`CollLine_Fix(.., 0x10, bomb)`) for at most 300 ticks (the fuse when flying). A world face ends
//! it at the hit; a moby's collision primitive **snaps** it to that moby's position (the hero and the glove only after
//! 10 ticks; a primitive only while the arc is less than 2 above its start); water only while falling. The point is
//! pulled 5 % toward the camera ([`pull_toward`]) and the draw callback `0x2c23c0` is registered on list 1
//! ([`Reticles`]): two 2×2 quads in the plane of the hit face's normal ([`reticle_quads`]), FX textures 0x11 and 0x12
//! at 0x80808080, ALPHA 0x48 (additive), turning once every 180 ticks in opposite directions. **Copies** (2026-09-28,
//! docs/plan/hero_gameplay.md §13; corrects §8's "the Bomb Glove's only"): the mine 74's preview `0x2bfa78` (gravity
//! 9.8, 120 ticks held, only faces end it: [`Prims::Ignore`]) with the draw `0x2bf420`, the decoy 203's `0x2d9760` and
//! the Glove of Doom's canister's `0x2de0a8` (gravity 9, 300 ticks, primitives snapped without the height rule) with
//! the draw `0x2d8e28` — the same quads and constants ([`BOMB_RETICLE`]). The decoy's and the canister's first update
//! (state 0) takes the flying branch and marks "a new object in the glove" on itself, so in the game they never draw
//! one (reproduced).
//!
//! Native `f32` throughout (`atan2` for `FastArcTan`).
