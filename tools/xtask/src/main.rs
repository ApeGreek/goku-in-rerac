cargo xtask <command> [options]    dev chores, one command each (tools/xtask/README.md)

commands:
  regen-data [--iso <image>] [--data-dir <dir>] [--force] [--check]
      Rebuild the dev game data folder (extracted/, or RC_EXTRACTED) from your disc image with the dev build of
      randcrw-extract: extract into a staging folder, verify it, then swap it in and delete the old folder.
      The retired C++ extractor's leftovers are listed and removed; any unknown file stops it unless --force.
        --iso <image>     the disc image (default: RC_ISO)
        --data-dir <dir>  the folder to rebuild (default: RC_EXTRACTED, else <repo>/extracted)
        --force           also delete unknown files
        --check           only list what the folder holds; change nothing (no disc needed)
  package [--no-build]
      Release packaging: runs tools/package/package.sh (dist/randcrw-<version>-<os>-<arch>/ and its .zip).
  sweep [--limit <size>] [--dry-run]
      Keep target/ under a size limit (default 30GB; sizes like 30GB, 20G, 500MB, 2GiB) with cargo-sweep: the
      least recently used build units go first (never incremental/; `cargo clean` is the full reset). Refuses while
      another cargo, rustc or cargo-nextest runs. Prints target/ before and after, and what went. Without cargo-sweep
      it prints `cargo install cargo-sweep --locked` and exits 0. test-full runs it at the end (a failure only warns).
        --dry-run         only show what it would remove

test tiers (docs/workflows/testing.md §1-2): the only way to run tests; never `cargo test` / `cargo nextest` by hand.
RC_AUDIO=0; cargo-nextest when installed, else `cargo test --workspace --features rc-engine/dev`.
  test-quick [crate]
      Unit tests only: every crate's lib and bin tests (`--lib --bins`, about 5 s). With nextest a crate name runs
      just that crate's (without nextest every crate runs: a single one would rebuild).
  test-job <area>... [--test <binary>]...
      The per-job tier: the unit tests plus the integration binaries of each area. Areas (aliases):
        hero, weapons, classes (creatures, mobys), world (levels, collision, water), ui (menus, hud, map, save,
        vendor), audio, formats, data, extract, video (movies), engine (render, input: unit tests only), trace,
        repo (guards, layout), shared (for shared code: the all-levels smoke, and the NO_IDLE hero digest
        compared with work/test-results/hero_digest_no_idle.txt).
      --test <binary>     also run this integration binary whole (repeatable); with no area, only the binaries
                          (no unit tests, no digest). Binaries: hero weapons classes world ui formats data extract
                          movies trace guards.
  test-full
      The full suite (on merge to main, or when the coordinator asks), then the NO_IDLE hero digest compared
      with the baseline; a mismatch fails. It never rewrites the baseline. Then `sweep` (a failure only warns).
  digest-baseline
      The only command that writes the NO_IDLE hero digest baseline, and prints what changed: for a human who
      has decided a digest change is intended, or before a job's first edit when there is none.
    Targeting options of test-quick and test-job (the same meaning under both runners):
      --filter <name>     only tests whose path contains <name> (repeatable: any), e.g. hero_novalis:: or a fn name;
                          a filtered test-job skips the digest
      --exact             the filters are full paths, <module>::<test_fn>
      --ignored           only the ignored tests (surveys, printers); a filtered test-job skips the digest
      --nocapture         show the tests' output
    Options of the test commands:
      --cargo-test        use `cargo test --workspace --features rc-engine/dev` even when nextest is installed
      -- <args>           passed on as is: to nextest, or to the test binaries under cargo test
